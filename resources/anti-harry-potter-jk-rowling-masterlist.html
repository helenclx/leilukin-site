                </p>

                <p>Like many millennials, I grew up with the <cite>Harry Potter</cite> series and was a major fan of the series. I had read the original 7 books and watched their film adaptations. The series was a passion of mine throughout my early- to mid-teen years. While the <cite>Harry Potter</cite> novels were far from the first books I read, they were the first fantasy novels I read, and the series’ concept of a magical world set in a contemporary setting fascinated teenage me.</p>

                <p>However, even during my <cite>Harry Potter</cite> fixation years, there were things from the series that bothered me, from the idea of house elves being a slave race that naturally love being slaves, to Snape’s unconvincing “redemption” arc. As I got older and became more aware of social issues, I started to notice more problems with the series. In addition, reading more books has also made me realise that even on a technical writing level, the <cite>Harry Potter</cite> series was mediocre at best. As a result, I had stopped becoming a <cite>Harry Potter</cite> fan even before J.K. Rowling’s transphobia got mainstream attention.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, many adults with nostalgia goggles still refuse to let go of <cite>Harry Potter</cite>, and they believe <cite>Harry Potter</cite> can be separated or “reclaimed” by J.K. Rowling, despite how much Rowling’s worldview and prejudice are inextricably linked to her writing.</p>

                <p>Therefore, I am compiling this masterlist by curating various materials that are critical of the <cite>Harry Potter</cite> series and J.K. Rowling. Items are ordered in chronological order. This is far from a comprehensive list of all the pieces that criticise <cite>Harry Potter</cite> and Rowling; this list is my curated list of ones that I have read, watched or listened to, and considered well-done critiques.</p>
