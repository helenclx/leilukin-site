                <p><a href="https://bawangqueerbooklet.msolidariti.org/" target="_blank">Floating in a Sky Full of Pride</a>, the LGBTQ+ booklet of <a href="https://misibawang.msolidariti.org/" target="_blank">MISI:Bawang</a>, a Malaysian digital booklet project, has been released on Valentine‚Äôs Day 2022. Since my submitted art piece, Life of a Bee with Pride, has been selected to be included in the booklet, I had received the honour of being interviewed by MISI:Bawang to share my personal experience with my LGBTQ+ identity, favourite queer art/media, and a ‚ú® special message to the Malaysian LGBTQ+ community. üè≥‚Äçüåà</p>

                <p>MISI:Bawang has shared their interview with me and other Malaysian LGBTQ+ artists and authors who submitted their work to the booklet on Twitter and Instagram. Here are the <a href="https://twitter.com/misi_bawang/status/1470247663471763464" target="_blank">Twitter thread</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CXSlIbsJXsM/" target="_blank">Instagram post</a> that include my interview.</p>
                
                <p>Text version of my interview below:</p>
                
                <h4><strong>‚ÄúWhat was your experience discovering your LGBTQ+ identity?‚Äù</strong></h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>The first clear signs of my attraction to women I was aware of started from my secondary school days. However, due to lack of knowledge and awareness of same-gender attraction and identities, I brushed it off as a teenage phase.</p>

                    <p>However, that changed as I started becoming active on Tumblr since I was 19. At first, I joined Tumblr to connect with people who share my interest in Star Wars and BioWare games. This led me to get to know LGBTQ+ from different parts of the world, which is especially helped by the fact that BioWare games are known for LGBTQ+ representation, therefore LGBTQ+ people are visible in BioWare player communities. This started my journey of questioning my sexuality and gender.</p>

                    <p>As I continue to stay on Tumblr, my engagement with LGBTQ+ people on Tumblr had gone beyond shared interest in entertainment media. Through Tumblr, I discovered many LGBTQ+ resources that helped me figure out my identity. As a result, at the age of 22, I eventually realised that I am a non-binary lesbian.</p>
                </blockquote>
                
                <h4><strong>‚ÄúAre there any LGBTQ+ related art (books, films, etc) that gives you comfort, inspiration, and strength? If so, tell us about them!‚Äù</strong></h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><cite>A Summer‚Äôs End - Hong Kong 1986</cite> is the LGBTQ+ art that gives me comfort, inspiration and strength the most. It is an indie visual novel developed by the Asian Canadian studio Oracle and Bone. The story is about a lesbian romance that takes place in Hong Kong in the year of 1986.</p>

                    <p><cite>A Summer‚Äôs End</cite> is the LGBTQ+ art I relate to most because it strongly resonates with my identity as a Cantonese-speaking Chinese lesbian who has grown up with Hong Kong media. I relate to both the protagonists, Michelle and Sam, as their characters represent different parts of my life as a Chinese lesbian. I also relate to the story‚Äôs theme of hoping for the future of our homeland despite the political uncertainties.</p>
                </blockquote>
                
                <h4><strong>‚ÄúDo you have a message to LGBTQ+ community living in Malaysia?‚Äù</strong></h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>First and foremost, you are not alone. LGBTQ+ Malaysians have a community that continues to survive despite the hardship we have to face due to society‚Äôs bigotry and misunderstanding of LGBTQ+ people and identities.</p>

                    <p>I hope the LGBTQ+ community in Malaysia will continue to grow and thrive, and more LGBTQ+ Malaysians who are still questioning and feeling lonely could be reached out. Let us work towards a future where we could live freely.</p>
                </blockquote>
