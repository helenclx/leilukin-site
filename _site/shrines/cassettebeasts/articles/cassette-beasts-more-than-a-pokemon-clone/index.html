<a class="heading-anchor" href="#introduction" aria-labelledby="introduction"><span hidden>#</span></a></div>
<p>There is no denying that <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> is one of the largest entertainment franchises in the world and the most influential series in the monster collector genre of video games, and thus inspiring many games in the genre. <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite>, an indie monster collecting role-playing game developed by the England-based indie studio Bytten Studio, is not an exception, as it does share similarities to <cite>Pok√©mon</cite>.</p>
<p>However, calling <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> a <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> clone is doing it a massive disservice, because <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> executes many mechanics and aspects of <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> games in different, and sometimes arguably better ways.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are things in <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> that you would not find in <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> games, at least in the main series games, thanks to Bytten Studio's creativity and passion that a gigantic corporate-owned franchise like <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> can only dream of.</p>

<h2 id="features-that-exist-in-pokemon-that-are-done-differently-in-cassette-beasts">Features that Exist in <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> that are Done Differently in <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite></h2>
<a class="heading-anchor" href="#features-that-exist-in-pokemon-that-are-done-differently-in-cassette-beasts" aria-labelledby="features-that-exist-in-pokemon-that-are-done-differently-in-cassette-beasts"><span hidden>#</span></a></div>
<p>By the time Cassette Beasts was released on 26 April 2023, the main video game series of Pok√©mon had reached its ninth generation with the release of Scarlet and Violet. Pok√©mon had existed for 27 years since the release of Red and Green versions in Japan in February 1996.</p>
<p>However, despite remaining one of the best-selling video game series in the world, Pok√©mon has got the reputation of repeating the same formula in their games over and over. Cassette Beasts, on the other hand, executes some features and mechanics that exist in the Pok√©mon game series with their own unique spin on them. Therefore, even the similarities between Cassette Beasts and Pok√©mon are not as straightforward as you may think.</p>

<p>By the time <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> was released on 26 April 2023, the main video game series of <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> had reached its ninth generation with the release of <cite>Scarlet</cite> and <cite>Violet</cite>. <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> had existed for 27 years since the release of <cite>Red</cite> and <cite>Green</cite> versions in Japan in February 1996.</p>
<p>However, despite remaining one of the best-selling video game series in the world, <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> has got the reputation of repeating the same formula in their games over and over. <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite>, on the other hand, executes some features and mechanics that exist in the <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> game series with their own unique spin on them. Therefore, even the similarities between <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> and <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> are not as straightforward as you may think.</p>
<h3>Monster Capture Mechanic</h3>
<p>One of the most notable differences between <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> and <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> is their mechanics to capture monsters. In <cite>Pok√©mon</cite>, you catch the creatures by using Pok√© Balls, but in <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite>, you do not actually catch the monsters, but you record the essence of the monsters into a cassette tape.</p>
<p>A common criticism of the monster collector genre is the ethical question of essentially enslaving creatures by capturing and subjugating them into obeying you, as well as enganging in dog fighting by making the creatures fight each other, to the extent that even <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> tries to tackle it as the main theme of the story of <cite>Black</cite> and <cite>White</cite>, though whether the execution is effective or not is debatable. <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite>' method of recording monsters solves this moral dilemma of the genre from the get-go, because you are not actually catching the monsters in the traditional sense. In fact, Jay Baylis, artist and writer of <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> had stated in <a href="https://youtu.be/P0L-5LLT9uw?feature=shared&amp;t=106">a Shacknews interview</a> that their idea of recording monsters is intended to avert the issue of basically enslaving creatures in the monster collecting genre.</p>
<p>Gameplay-wise, a notable improvement <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> has over <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> when it comes to monster capture mechanics is that in <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite>, when you are recording a monster, the percentage of success rate is displayed on screen. Furthermore, a monster that is in the process of being recorded cannot be knocked out, so you can deal more damage to the monster to improve your odds of successfully recording the monster. In <cite>Pok√©mon</cite>, you have to be extra careful about not knocking out the Pok√©mon you want to catch, and when you try to catch one, you can only hope that the RNG is in your favour.</p>
<div class="heading-wrapper h3">
<h3 id="battle-system">Battle System</h3>
<a class="heading-anchor" href="#battle-system" aria-labelledby="battle-system"><span hidden>#</span></a></div>
<p>The battle system in both <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> and <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> involves fights between monsters. However, while in <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> you send out the monsters you captured to fight, in <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> you transform into monsters to battle by using the cassette tapes you have used to record the monsters.</p>
<p>Furthermore, most of the battles in the main series <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> games take place in one-on-one formats, also known as single battles. In <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite>, you almost always battle alongside a partner, making two-on-two the format of most battles in the game, which in <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> is also known as double battles, which are underutilised in the main series <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> games. Two-on-two battles require more nuanced strategies than brute-forcing a single opponent in one-on-one battles.</p>
<p>The move system in battles is also different in <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> and <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite>. In <cite>Pok√©mon</cite>, every Pok√©mon is limited to having four move slots, meaning each can only use up to four moves in battle. In <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite>, battle moves come in the form of stickers on monster cassette tapes; the base number of sticker slots varies between monsters, with 4 being the minimum, and can be increased by upgrading the star level of the monster tapes, up to a maximum of 8 natural slots. Some stickers have the bonus of adding sticker slots.</p>
<p><cite>Pok√©mon</cite> uses Power Points (PP) to restrict how many times each move can be, while <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> uses Action Points (AP), which is generated for every turn during battle, even after you switch into a different monster tape. Different moves cost varying amounts of AP or none at all, with stronger moves require more AP to use, while some moves require no AP.</p>
<div class="heading-wrapper h3">
<h3 id="type-match-ups">Type Match-Ups</h3>
<a class="heading-anchor" href="#type-match-ups" aria-labelledby="type-match-ups"><span hidden>#</span></a></div>
<p>Both <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> and <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> have elemental types on every monster, and how these types interact with each other is a core element in their battle systems. However, how said interactions play out in <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> and <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> are different.</p>
<p>In <cite>Pok√©mon</cite>, type advantage simply means dealing extra damage to your opponent, while type disadvantage simply means dealing less damage, and certain types are immune to damage from another type.</p>
<p>In <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite>, type match-ups are based on chemical reactions, so type advantage gives your opponent a debuff, while type disadvantage gives your opponent a buff, and certain types and temporary change the type of the opponent in battle. For example, Water-type moves reduce the melee and ranged attacks of Fire-type monsters; Fire-type moves giving a healing buff to Water-type monsters; Fire-type moves turn Plastic-type monsters into Poison-types. While type advantage means more damage in <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite>, it is not as drastic as in <cite>Pok√©mon</cite>.</p>
<p><cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> actually provides an in-game type chart in the game itself. You can obtain the chart by opening the Ranger Guidebook, and the type chart can be accessed during your battles. In addition, when you are choosing your moves during battles, you can see the icons that hint on the effects of your moves against your opponent.</p>

<h3 id="level-system">Level System</h3>
<a class="heading-anchor" href="#level-system" aria-labelledby="level-system"><span hidden>#</span></a></div>
<p>In both <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> and <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite>, gaining experience to level up is a core part of the games' progression. However, there are differences in their level systems.</p>
<p>In <cite>Pok√©mon</cite>, from Generation 1 to 5, only the Pok√©mon you send out in battle and optionally the Pok√©mon that holds the Exp. Share item will gain experience after winning a battle. This means that if you want to add a Pok√©mon you just caught to your party, you often have to grind for experience points for the newly-caught Pok√©mon to catch up with the levels of other members in your party. The games starting from Generation 6 solve the grinding issue by making Exp. Share becomes an optional item that will reward the experience points you earned to all non-fainted members in your party. Starting from <cite>Let's Go! Pikachu</cite> and<cite> Let's Go! Eevee</cite>, the effects Exp. Share are present from the start of the game.</p>
<p>In <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite>, levels are instead tied to your human and your companion characters, which means that in addition to base stats, the strength of the monsters you recorded are tied to your human character's level. This means that unlike <cite>Pok√©mon</cite>, after you record a low-level monster and add them to your party, you do not have to spend time in grinding the levels of your monsters just to make them catch up with the rest of your party.</p>
<p>Monster tapes have their own level system in the form of the star system. When you upgrade a monster's star level, they gain new stickers. When you upgrade a monster to 5 stars, the monster will gain an additional biography entry in the bestiary, and some monsters can be remastered (the <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> equivalent is evolution) into stronger forms.</p>
<p>Earning experience points means not only levelling up your human player and companion characters, but also upgrading the star levels of your monster tapes. Some monsters can be remastered when being upgraded to 5 stars. It is worth noting that experience points are shared between all your monster tapes as well, including ones that have been broken (or &quot;fainted&quot;) in battle, unlike <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> where fainted Pok√©mon cannot gain any experience points at all.</p>
<div class="heading-wrapper h3">
<h3 id="field-moves">Field Moves</h3>
<a class="heading-anchor" href="#field-moves" aria-labelledby="field-moves"><span hidden>#</span></a></div>
<p>Both <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> and <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> have field moves ‚Äî moves that are used outside of battles and often required to access new areas of the map and explore every nook and cranny.</p>
<p>From Generation 1 to 6 of the main series <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> games, field moves usually take the form of HMs, though some TMs also have uses outside battles. Both HMs and TMs are items to teach Pok√©mon moves, and these moves take up move slots. From Generation 7 onwards, <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> games remove HMs, and assign field moves to certain Pok√©mon that you can use outside battles, so you longer need to worry about wasting move slots of Pok√©mon in your party.</p>
<p>In Cassette Beats, it is your human character that learn these field moves by recording certain monsters. The game will provide hints to which monsters can give you these field moves through townsfolk gossips. Since it is your human character that uses these field moves, you do not need to worry about wasting any move slots in your monster cassette tapes.</p>

<p>In both <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> and <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite>, there is a rare chance you may encounter monsters with different colour schemes than their regular counterparts. In <cite>Pok√©mon</cite>, they are referred to as Shiny Pok√©mon, while in Cassette Beasts, they are called bootlegs.</p>
<p>Shiny Pok√©mon do not provide additional benefits in gameplay, but bootlegs do, since bootlegs can be of any type, and have a higher chance of getting moves (or stickers) with additional effects and enhancements, referred to as <a href="https://wiki.cassettebeasts.com/wiki/Sticker_Attributes">sticker attributes</a>.</p>

<p>Both <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> and <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> are notable for their soundtracks, and music is among the most praised (which is well-deserved, in my opinions) aspects in both, though <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> does it differently in that it includes music with vocal lyrics: for the music of the main hub, Habourtown, the vocals play when you are indoor; for battle music, the vocals play when you and your partner fuse, which heightens the dynamic of the battles.</p>

<h3 id="story-and-plot">Story and Plot</h3>
<a class="heading-anchor" href="#story-and-plot" aria-labelledby="story-and-plot"><span hidden>#</span></a></div>
<p>The core plot of the main series <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> games, except for <cite>Legends: Arceus</cite>, is about a child going on a journey and become the best Pok√©mon Trainer in their region by claiming the Champion title. However, the main plot of <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> is about the protagonist finding their way back home after bring transported to New Wirral, an island that exists in a different dimension from Earth and where humans from various dimensions are also transported and strended on.</p>
<p>The protagonists of <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> games become the new Champion of their region by defeating Gym Leaders or Trial Captains, then the Elite Four and the current standing Champion. In <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite>, the closest thing to an equivalent to Gym Leaders is the Ranger Captains, and one of the main quests involves defeating all the Captains across the map, but even then, you do not beat the Ranger Captains and become a Captain yourself for the glory of becoming the best monster battler, but to prove your ability to help the Rangers Guild to protect New Wirral and support the island's community.</p>
<p><cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> has a more mature and adult story than <cite>Pok√©mon</cite>. As a franchise primarily targetted at children, the main human characters in <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> are children, so the stories of <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> games are mainly about children's fantasy adventures to be the best Pok√©mon Trainer. On the flip side, the main characters in <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite>, including your human companions, are adults, and the game is not afraid to discuss topics and issues relevant to adulthood, particularly through the stories of your companion characters. The story of <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> is also unabashedly left-wing with anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist messages, which I frankly doubt will get explored with such authenticity in a corporate-owned mega franchise like <cite>Pok√©mon</cite>.</p>
<p>In addition, <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite>' story can get genuinely dark at times, most notably in the cosmic horror presented by the Archangels, the eldritch entities that you need to defeat in boss battles to gather clues about a way out of New Wirral and return home.</p>

    <summary class="spoiler-accordion__hint">Major Story Spoilers for <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite></summary>
    <div class="spoiler-accordion__spoiler">
        <p>Towards the end of the main quest, it is revealed that Archangels are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egregore" target="_blank">egregores</a> created from humanity's desires and ideas. Aleph, the main antagonist and final boss of the main story, is an Archangel that is an incarnation of conquest, and his goal is to leave New Wirral and cause chaos across reality.</p>
        <p>While <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> has its own fair share of sinister villains, the threat the main villain of <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> poses is even greater in scope than any <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> villain, maybe except for Rainbow Rocket Giovanni from <cite>Ultra Sun</cite> and <cite>Ultra Moon</cite>, who shares the goal of ruling the multiverse.</p>
        <p>Moreover, even though the player character and their party are able to defeat the main villain in the end, the game makes it clear that since Archangels are not flesh and blood and born from human ideas, as long as humans are interested in conquest Aleph will return at some point. This reflects our world in that defeating a tyrant does not magically solve everything, especially when the system that enables tyrants' rise to power still exists.</p>

<p><cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> is not satisfied with just doing <cite>Pok√©mon</cite>'s core mechanics in different ways, but it also adds features that do not exist in the <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> games, at least in the main series games as of <cite>Scarlet</cite> and <cite>Violet</cite>.</p>
<p>In this section, I am adding a counter for the things <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> has that <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> lacks, to further prove that <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> is perfectly capable of standing on its own apart from <cite>Pok√©mon</cite>. If Bytten Studios only want to make a <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> clone, they did not need to do these additional things at all, but they did it anyway. If this is still not evidence of Bytten Studio's passion for their game to build its own identity, I do not know what is.</p>
<p>Even if one day the <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> games decide to add any of the below features, it would still not change the fact that <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> had done them earlier.</p>

<p>I use they/them pronouns myself, so pronouns options are a welcome addition.</p>

<a class="heading-anchor" href="#fusions-of-every-monster" aria-labelledby="fusions-of-every-monster"><span hidden>#</span></a></div>
<p>The concept of monster fusions by combining the designs of two monsters together are popular in the <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> fandom, showing up in fan art and dedicated websites such as web developer Alex Onsager's <a href="https://pokemon.alexonsager.net/">Pokemon Fusion website</a>. However, in the official <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> franchise, fusions are exclusive to very few Pok√©mon to create alternate forms, namely Kyurem, Necrozma and Calyrex, all Legendary Pok√©mon, and they can only fuse with a specific few Legendary Pok√©mon.</p>
<p>In <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite>, monster fusions are a defining feature both in gameplay and the lore. Any two of the 141 monsters in-game can fuse together, thus there are 19,881 fusion combination in total. The nature and origins of fusion is also explored in the game's story and lore.</p>

<h3 id="companion-and-relationship-system-with-human-characters">Companion and Relationship System with Human Characters</h3>
<a class="heading-anchor" href="#companion-and-relationship-system-with-human-characters" aria-labelledby="companion-and-relationship-system-with-human-characters"><span hidden>#</span></a></div>
<p>While the primary draw of the <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> franchise has always been the monster creatures, like other media in the mons genre, human characters do play a notable role in the <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> franchise from the beginning: in the main series games, you play as a human trainer of Pok√©mon, battling other human NPC trainers including your rivals, Gym Leaders/Trial Captains, Elite Four, Champions and villains. In some games, you also occasionally team up with other human NPC trainers in battles. However, the main series <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> games do not have any dedicated companion and relationship mechanic with human characters.</p>
<p>Conversely, human relationships are a major focus in <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> both in story and game mechanics: you are accompanied by a companion character throughout your adventures in New Wirral, with 5 out of 6 of the potential partners being humans; each companion character has their own story and quest for you to explore; each have a relationship level that can be raised by gaining experience points with them, and higher relationship levels make you stronger when you fuse in battle.</p>
<p>Human characters in <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> interest me as much as the creatures themselves, because the Pok√©mon world is populated by both Pok√©mon and humans, thus I find the humans' relationships with the creatures and each other also an important element of the Pok√©mon world. Unfortunately, I often feel that human characters are an aspect of the <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> games that are underappreciated by the Western Pok√©mon fandom, who tend to focus more on the creatures themselves. Therefore, seeing a <cite>Pok√©mon</cite>-inspired game, especially one that is developed by a Western studio like <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite>, actually make the effort in fleshing out human characters and relationships was the biggest pleasant surprise for me when I started playing <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> for the first time.</p>
<p><cite>Pok√©mon</cite> has a spin-off game that focus more on human characters: <cite>Pok√©mon Masters EX</cite>, but the fact that it is a gacha game means it is a glorified gambling game that wants you to spend real-world money to gamble to collect the human trainers. However, that is not the case at all in <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite>, since it does not have any in-app purchases whatsovever. In fact, <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite>' companion and relationship systems prove that <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> can do more with their human characters without predatory monetisation tactics.</p>

<h3 id="romance-options">Romance Options</h3>
<a class="heading-anchor" href="#romance-options" aria-labelledby="romance-options"><span hidden>#</span></a></div>
<p>Related to the above point about the companion system and relationship mechanic with human characters, the main series <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> games do not have any option for the player to pursue a romance with another character. The closest the main series games attempted a romance arc for the player character is <cite>Omega Ruby</cite> and <cite>Alpha Sapphire</cite>, where the protagonist and their neighbour rival are implied to become a couple in the post-game story by going on a date, as well as <cite>Black 2</cite> and <cite>White 2</cite>, where the protagonist can pursue an optional subplot with a different-gender NPC who eventually develops a crush on the protagonist.</p>
<p><cite>Cassette Beasts</cite>, on the other hand, as an addition to its companion system and relationship mechanic, provides players the option to pursue a romance with one of their human companions after raising their relationship level to 5, the highest without romance, with unambiguously romantic dialogue and scenes.</p>
<p>Even though I do not play monster collecting games for romances, nor am I asking for <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> to add romance options to their games because I am too old to be invested in romances involving fictional children, romance options are a nice addition to a game that is made with adult players in mind like <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite>.</p>
<p><strong>They Did Not Need To But They Did It Anyway counter: 4</strong></p>
<p>If the existence of the option to romance your human companion is not enough, in <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> you can romance any of the human companions regardless of your player character's gender. In other words, all the human companions in <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> are available as same-gender romance options, which is a blessing for LGBTQ+ players like me.</p>

<a class="heading-anchor" href="#canon-lgbtq-characters-and-representation" aria-labelledby="canon-lgbtq-characters-and-representation"><span hidden>#</span></a></div>
<p><cite>Pok√©mon</cite> is not known for explicitly canon LGBTQ+ representation. The franchise does not have a single confirmed canon same-gender couple. In the shipping side of the <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> fandom, particularly among LGBTQ+ fans, some same-gender pairings are popular, but it does not change the fact that there is no character in the <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> franchise who is officially confirmed to be attracted to the same-gender.</p>
<p>On the flip side, <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> has canon LGBTQ+ characters. For characters who are attracted to the samge gender, the most notable ones are the human companions, who can be romanced by the player character regardless of gender, meaning they are canonically bisexual. Furthermore, the game also has a pair of NPCs who are revealed in-game to be a gay married couple.</p>

Yes, <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> has a canon married lesbian couple.</p>

<p>As for transgender and non-binary representation, <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> has a few ambiguously canon ones, namely <a href="https://lgbtqgamearchive.com/2016/05/25/beauty-nova-in-pokemon-xy/">Beauty Nova</a>, a minor female NPC Trainer from <cite>X</cite> and <cite>Y</cite> who is heavily implied to be a trans woman, and <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Blanche">Blanche</a> from <cite>Pok√©mon GO</cite>, who is not referred to by gendered pronouns in the English version of the game and official social media accounts. Some other human characters are also commonly interpreted or headcanonned as trans by LGBTQ+ fans, but none of them are officially confirmed to be trans or non-binary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite>, not only that the player can chose to go by they/them pronouns via the character creator, but there is also a Ranger Captain named <a href="https://wiki.cassettebeasts.com/wiki/Skip" target="blank">Skip</a> who is canonically non-binary and uses they/them pronouns.</p>

<p>In addition to having canon LGBTQ+ characters, <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite>'s voice cast also includes multiple openly LGBTQ+ voice actors, such as Allegra Clark, J. Michael Tatum, Kayleigh McKee, Liz Morey, Marin M. Miller and Risa Mei. In fact, both Captain Skip and their voice actor Marin M. Miller are non-binary and go by they/them pronouns.</p>
<p>Looking for LGBTQ+ representation in monster collecting games? Instead of waiting for corporate franchises like <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> to give you scraps, how about looking at indie titles that actually has canon LGBTQ+ characters like <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> instead?</p>

<p>Despite some attempts to tell more developed stories with more dialogue and cinematic cutscenes, as of <cite>Scarlet</cite> and <cite>Violet</cite>, none of the main series <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> games have any voice acting in their dialogue.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> has voiced dialogue. Even though the amount of voiced dialogue in <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> is limited, voice acting helps to bring the characters to life and add more character to the game.</p>
<p>It is more notable when you remember that being an indie game, <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> could have completely avoid adding voice acting to save development budget, but the developers added it anyway.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<a class="heading-anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-labelledby="conclusion"><span hidden>#</span></a></div>
<p>While it is understandable to compare <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> to <cite>Pok√©mon</cite>, <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> has countless claims to forge its own identity apart from the pioneer of the monster collecting role-playing game genre, as explained throughout this essay. As someone who has played <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> games since the <cite>Red Version</cite> from Generation 1, but has become jaded with the state of the series since <cite>Sword</cite> and <cite>Shield</cite> from Generation 8 and is losing interest in playing their recent titles, <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> provides a perfect indie alternative for something different.</p>
<p>Frequent releases and rushed development schedules have taken their toll on the quality of recent <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> titles, resulting in cutting corners like empty maps, removal of National Pok√©Dex, etc., and in the case of <cite>Scarlet</cite> and <cite>Violet</cite>, glitches and performance issues. Furthermore, as a multi-billion dollar corporate-owned franchise, <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> is primarily targeted at children and meant to be able to be enjoyed by everyone, so despite a few attempts to do something new, maximising profit is still prioritised over innovation.</p>
<p>Art that tries to appeal to everyone, even if not bad, tends to be bland and reluctant to take creative risks. <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> is another evidence that indie games can be much more creative than AAA games.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you think you have outgrown <cite>Pok√©mon</cite> and looking for a more sophisticated and mature monster collector game that actually treats the player like an adult, go play <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite>.</p>
