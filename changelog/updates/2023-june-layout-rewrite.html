                <img src="../layouts/Leilukins-Hub-layout-2023-06.png" alt="A screenshot of Leilukin's Hub home page, with its new layout released on June 23, 2023" width="100%" height="auto">
                
                <p>Happy Pride Month! It is always Pride on this literally <a href="https://isaacfish.neocities.org/webring/" target="_blank">queer-coded</a> (as in, literally coded by a queer person) website, so Leilukin's Hub decided to celebrate Pride Month with a major update â€” rewriting the entire website's layout!</p>

                <p>This new layout remains the same colour scheme as the previous one, which went live in January this year. The most noticeable change you would see in this new layout is the sticky navigation bar, a feature that previously only existed in <a href="/shrines/">my shrines</a>. However, under the hood the HTML, CSS and JavaScript all have been rewritten from the ground up to optimise the site's layout.</p>

                <h2>Highlights of the 2023 New Year redesign of Leilukin's Hub:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A new navigation bar throughout the entire website, instead of putting links to this site's pages on the sidebar. The design of this navigation bar is inspired by the dropdown menu bar at the end of this article: <a href="https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/best-practices-for-responsive-dropdown-menus--cms-35212" target="_blank">6 Best Practices for Building Responsive Dropdown Menus</a>.</li>
                    <li>Rewrite the HTML elements to improve the website's layout.</li>
                    <li>Use a mobile-first workflow to rewrite the CSS of this website to make the website more responsive to various screen sizes (mobile, tablet and desktop). </li>
                    <li>Streamline the CSS of the main parts of the site into one CSS file. The only pages that also have their own CSS due to unique elements with custom classes exclusive to the pages are <a href="/mymods/">my mod pages</a>. The shrines still have their own CSS files, however.</li>
                    <li>Use <a href="https://andy-bell.co.uk/a-modern-css-reset/" target="_blank">Andy Bell's modern CSS reset</a> for the CSS of the entire website.</li>
                    <li>Use <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/reusable-html-components-how-to-reuse-a-header-and-footer-on-a-website/" target="_blank">custom HTML elements</a> for components that are shared across multiple pages, including the header, navigation bar and footer</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Rewriting the layout of this entire website has taken me many hours on this site redesign. Nevertheless, I am very pleased with how it turns out. Enjoy!</p>
