* Added a [Links](/links) page.
* Move the link to [changelog](/changelogs/) to the sidebar.
* Due to these new changes to the navigation links on the sidebar, I wrote a JavaScript file to dynamically generate the contents on the right sidebar and the footer across multiple pages on this site.
* Adjust the line spacing and the spacing between the listed items on the [changelog](/changelogs/) page.
* Made adjustments to the relative paths in the HTML files, to ensure this site's favicons will show up on the title bar by default.
* Fixed the issue of the page style not applied to the Not Found page.
* Updated the [About](/about) page.
* Update the [Page Not Found](/not_found) page.
