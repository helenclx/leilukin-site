* Preload the Lexend regular and Lexend 700 font files to improve site performance, remove flash of unstyled text (FOUT) and prevent Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).

Read the ["What Happens Now with My Neocities Account"](/blog/posts/2024-05-31-domain-name-hosting-change-leilukins-hub/#what-happens-now-with-my-neocities-account) section of my blog post, "Custom Domain Name and Hosting Change for Leilukin's Hub" for more information.
