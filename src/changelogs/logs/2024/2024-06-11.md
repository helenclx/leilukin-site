* Improve "Back to top" button and footer link:
    * Replace arrow unicode with inline SVG for the button and border styling for the footer link
    * Display the footer link only if JavaScript is disabled
    * Use anchor HTML tag (`<a>`) instead of button tag (`<button>`) for the button
* Disable smooth scrolling for users with reduced motion settings.
