Even though this website is primarily meant to be my own space of self-expression, I also want every visitor to my website to have the best possible experience of browsing my website. Therefore, I strive to design this website to be accessible, including to disabled and neurodivergent people.

Currently, this site includes the following accessibility features:

* Fully responsive and mobile-friendly layout
* Semantic HTML
* Alt text for all non-decorative images
* No autoplaying music or video
* Proper colour contrast for backgrounds, text, and links
* Font sizes, margins and paddings use relative units such as rem/em instead of absolute units such as px for scalability
* Site is functional up to 200% text zoom
* Allows reader mode to be enabled for articles and blog posts
* Visible outline when an interactive element is focused
* Uses the [Lexend](https://www.lexend.com/) font family as the default font and [Intel One Mono](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/company-overview/one-monospace-font.html) as the monospace font to improve text readability

I use the following tools to test my site for accessibility:
* WebAIM's [WAVE Browser Extension](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/)
* [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/about-nvda/) screen reader for Windows

In addition, I test the accessibility of my website manually by navigating with keyboard alone.

Feedbacks from disabled and neurodivergent people are welcome. You can [contact me via email](mailto:{{sitemeta.siteAuthor.email}}) for feedbacks and suggestions for improving the accessibility of this site
