Even though this website is primarily meant to be my own space of self-expression, I also want every visitor to my website to have the best possible experience of browsing my website. Accessibility is also relevant to me as a disabled and neurodivergent person.

Therefore, I strive to design my website to be accessible, including to fellow disabled and neurodivergent people, by aiming to meet [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) Level AA standards.

High-level overview of the accessibility features of this site:
* Responsive design and mobile-friendly layout
* Semantic HTML, enhanced by Web Accessibility Initiative â€“ Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)
* Sufficient colour contrast between text and background colours
*  Alt text for all non-decorative images, occasionally accompanied with longer image descriptions
* Keyboard navigation-friendly: Every interactive element can be focused and interacted with keyboard buttons, with visible outline when focused
* Logical content and heading flow
* Links to skip to the main content or the top of the page
* Sufficient font size that can be enlarged without breaking the site layout
* No autoplaying audio or video

This site uses the [Lexend](https://www.lexend.com/) font family as the default font and [Intel One Mono](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/company-overview/one-monospace-font.html) as the monospace font to improve text readability.

I use the following tools to test my site for accessibility:
* WebAIM's [WAVE Browser Extension](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/)
* [ANDI Accessibility Testing Tool](https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/andi/help/install.html)
* [C. Liam Brown's Colour Contrast Tool](https://cliambrown.com/contrast/)
* [Acart Communications' Contrast Checker](https://contrastchecker.com/)
* [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/about-nvda/) screen reader for Windows
* TalkBack screen reader for Android
* VoiceOver screen reader for iOS

In addition, I test the accessibility of my website manually by navigating with keyboard alone.

Feedbacks from disabled and neurodivergent people are welcome. You can [contact me via email](mailto:{{sitemeta.siteAuthor.email}}) for feedbacks and suggestions for improving the accessibility of this site.
