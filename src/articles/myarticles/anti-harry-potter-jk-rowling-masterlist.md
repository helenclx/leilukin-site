Like many millennials, I grew up with the {% cite "Harry Potter" %} series and was a major fan of the series. I had read the original 7 books and watched their film adaptations. The series was a passion of mine during my early- to mid-teen years. While the {% cite "Harry Potter" %} novels were far from the first books I read, they were the first fantasy novels I read, and the series’ concept of a magical world set in a contemporary setting fascinated teenage me.

However, even during my {% cite "Harry Potter" %} fixation years, there were things from the series that bothered me, from the idea of house elves being a slave race that naturally love being slaves, to Snape’s unconvincing “redemption” arc. As I got older and became more aware of social issues, I started to notice more problems with the series. In addition, reading more books has also made me realise that even on a technical writing level, the {% cite "Harry Potter" %} series was mediocre at best. As a result, I had stopped becoming a {% cite "Harry Potter" %} fan even before J. K. Rowling’s transphobia got mainstream attention.

Unfortunately, many adults with nostalgia goggles still refuse to let go of {% cite "Harry Potter" %}, and they believe {% cite "Harry Potter" %} can be separated or “reclaimed” by J. K. Rowling, despite how much Rowling’s worldview and prejudice are inextricably linked to her writing.

Therefore, I am compiling this masterlist by curating various materials that are critical of the {% cite "Harry Potter" %} series and J. K. Rowling. Items are ordered in chronological order. This is far from a comprehensive list of all the pieces that criticise {% cite "Harry Potter" %} and Rowling; this list is my curated list of ones that I have read, watched or listened to, and I personally endorse.
