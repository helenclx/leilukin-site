From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.

Here, I am compiling a list of resources related to Palestine. This list is not comprehensive by any means, but I still want to do my part in using my platform to support an important cause.

## Boycotts

* [BDS Movement](https://bdsmovement.net/)
* [No Tech For Apartheid](https://www.notechforapartheid.com/)
* Attention to website owners: [Boycott Wix](https://boycottwix.org/) — The BDS movement has [listed Wix as an organic boycott target](https://bdsmovement.net/Act-Now-Against-These-Companies-Profiting-From-Genocide), meaning the BDS movement did not initiate this grassroots boycott campaign, but supports it due to the boycotted brand's complicity in Israel's genocide and apartheid against Palestinians.

## Spotlight Crowdfunding Campaigns

There are Palestinians who have reached out to me on Tumblr to ask for help with sharing their fundraising campaigns, so I am using my platform to share them. These campaigns have been verified by other Palestinians and trusted sources (including ones who are on Tumblr), so I encourage you to help to donate and share at the best of your abilities.
