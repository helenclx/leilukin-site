In 2025, Eid al-Fitr fell on March 31.

While I am not a Muslim, I live in a majorly-Muslim country, so Eid al-Fitr is a major event. Every year, the leader of my state, referred to as the Chief Minister, hosts an open house on Eid al-Fitr where everyone can attend, with free meals and music performances available. Fun fact, in Malaysia, Eid al-Fitr is commonly referred to its Malay name, [<i>Hari Raya Aidilfitri</i>]{lang=ms} or [<i>Hari Raya Puasa</i>]{lang=ms}, even when speaking English.

When the Chief Minister of my state hosts a open house for Eid al-Fitr, we would attend for a free lunch. Unsurprisingly, the free meals have always attracted a lot of people. Unfortunately, as an autistic person, I do not do particularly well in crowds as I am sensitive to loud sounds and my mind is rather easy to be overwhelmed by an unpredictable environment.

On top of that, my visual disabilities, especially with [retinitis pigmentosa](/articles/living-with-retinitis-pigmentosa/) (RP) weakening my peripheral vision, seeing and navigating my surroundings becomes more challenging in a large crowd. In fact, this year also marked my first visit to the Chief Minister's Eid al-Fitr open house since I got diagnosed with RP. During this visit, I tripped on a makeshift stair because I could not see the edge of the stairs clearly.

As for the food, I took [char kway teow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Char_kway_teow), [biryani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biryani), [cendol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cendol), glutinous rice and watermelon.

March 31 was also the [International Transgender Day of Visibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Transgender_Day_of_Visibility). As a queer person, I noticed the interesting coincidence of Trans Day of Visibility and Eid al-Fitr fell on the same day in 2025.

On Leilukin's Hub, one of the ways I use JavaScript on my website is make the header display a top bar and changes the header background on certain days, including LGBTQ+-related events such as Trans Day of Visibility. For Trans Day of Visibility, my header background changed to the [transgender pride flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_flag), and the top bar linked to [Many Genders One Voice's Trans Day of Visibility page](https://www.manygendersonevoice.org/tdov.html#/). This setup was inspired by [KOTOR Community Portal](https://kotor.neocities.org/).

I would like to give a special shout-out to trans Muslims, and wish them a joyous day.
