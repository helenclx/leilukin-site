Having to endure an unscheduled water supply cut that lasted more than a day was not in my 2025 bingo card, let alone having to experience it *twice* in the same year.

In [late May](2025-05-24-water-supply-disruption.md), my house experienced the longest unexpected water supply disruption in my life — an unexpected breakdown of the main pumps that channel water to our area's water treatment plant caused an unscheduled water supply cut in my city that lasted more than two days.

Five months later, on November 1, Saturday morning, my city went through another massive unexpected water supply disruption that also affected my house; this time caused by pollution in the water source occurred on October 31 (yes, on Halloween, though Halloween is not widely celebrated in Malaysia).

Like in May, this time the water supply cut once gain happened when I was about to do the laundry. Unfortunately, on the next day when we tried to visit a laundry shop to wash our clothes that had been piled up for days, the ones we found either also ran out of water or closed shop, presumably due to the water supply cut.

Like before, the long water supply disruption meant we could not cook, so we had to have meals in a restaurant outside our house, or have takeaway food bought from a restaurant to our house.

Finally, on November 2, Sunday night, our house's water supply started to come back. This round of water supply disruption lasted shorter than in May, but as I said before, unexpected water supply disruption already causes inconvenience even if it lasts only a day, but one that lasts more than a day is even worse, and absolutely not an experience I want to relive ever again.

We could have never predicted that 2025 would be a year we got distressed by water supply disruption.
