I just received my first smartwatch: Xiaomi Smart Band 9.

This Xiaomi Smart Band 9 was a free gift from my father's purchase of Redmi Note 14 Pro 5G. My mother had bought the same Xiaomi smartwatch for herself a while ago, so my parents gave this new one to me. Since the "mi" ([米]{lang=zh}) in Xiaomi's Chinese name [小米]{lang=zh} also means rice in Chinese, my parents jokingly referred to my father buying a new Redmi Note smartphone as "buying rice" ([买米]{lang=zh}).

My parents and I have been Xiaomi customers for years since we purchased our first Redmi Note budget smartphones. My current smartphone is Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G, so I used my Redmi smartphone to set up my Xiaomi smartwatch as well. Yes, the photo above of me wearing Xiaomi Smart Band 9 was taken with the camera in my Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G.

As I have entered my 30s, my parents have encouraged me to do my best to take good care of my health before it is too late. Recently during Lunar New Year, my eldest paternal aunt commented that I had gained weight since the last time she saw me nearly a year ago. I never considered getting a smartwatch before, but now that I have one, I may as well make good use of it by keeping track of my health information, so hopefully it will help me to stay healthy.
