30 May 2025 marked the first anniversary of my domain name leilukin.com, which I have [used for this website since renting it last year](2024-05-31-domain-name-hosting-change-leilukins-hub.md).

In mid-May, I was reminded that late May would also be the birthday of leilukin.com domain name, but unfortunately I forgot to celebrate the occasion on May 30.  Fortunately, as a queer person, renting my first domain name shortly before the start of Pride Month also made the occasion meaningful to me, so as it is now June in my time zone as I am writing this, I was reminded of the anniversary of leilukin.com again, and decided to write this post to finally celebrate the occasion.

When I set up and use leilukin.com after placing an order for it on [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/) last year, I used [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to host this website. However, this website has changed hosts multiple times since then — first [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/my)'s premium shared hosting plan in July 2024, then [my first virtual private server](2025-05-19-my-vps-arc-began.md) (VPS) recently in May 2025, then a new VPS a week later to this day. This reflects another major benefit of a custom domain name for your website — allowing visitors to view your website without changing the website address, even if you switch hosts for your website.

I am happy with my decision to have a domain name for my website. Therefore, even before approaching its anniversary, I had renewed leilukin.com, and intend to make use of this domain name as long as I am able.

Furthermore, I am pleased to inform that Porkbun's service is indeed great, not only for their affordable pricing for domain names, but also for having great customer support, which I had positive experience with. If you are looking for a domain name registrar, I cannot recommend Porkbun enough.

Happy Birthday, leilukin.com, and Happy Pride Month!
