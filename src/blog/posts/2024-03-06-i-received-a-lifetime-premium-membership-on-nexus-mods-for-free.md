Wow, I just got informed by Nexus Mods via email and website notification that I have received a lifetime Premium membership for free on Nexus Mods as a mod author reward, since [all my mods that are hosted on Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/3041255?tab=user+files) have reached 30,000 unique downloads in total!

It was actually only through receiving this reward that I learned about Nexus Mods' [program to reward free Premium memberships to mod authors](https://www.nexusmods.com/news/14933).

I never spent a single cent on Nexus Mods, and my mods are all passion projects, so I never expected to enjoy any extra benefits or privileges on Nexus Mods.

That said, I cannot complain about receiving a premium membership on a website I use regularly for free, even though the unlimited mod download speed is the only benefit I am really interested in. After all, I do download a lot of mods for various video games from Nexus Mods.
