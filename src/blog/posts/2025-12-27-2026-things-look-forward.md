2025 is coming to an end. I do not typically plan new year resolutions, because the older I got, the more aware I am of how unpredictable the future can be, and unexpected things that can disrupt our plan can happen anytime.

That does not mean that I do not have anything to look forward to in 2026, however.

## Finishing the Core Curriculum of 42 the School

The biggest event in my 2025 was me attending [42 the computer science school](/topics/42-the-school). The school is my opportunity to continue learning programming and software development.

Since the bootcamp, I have been working hard in my study at 42, where my efforts were awarded as I got qualified to attend the core curriculum, and become one of the first batch of core curriculum students in my local campus of 42.

Students are suggested to take one to two years to complete the core curriculum, which is divided into 7 milestones, Milestones 0 to 6, each with suggested deadlines.

As of this writing, I am currently in Milestone 2, the third out of seven milestones in the core curriculum. Recently, earlier in December, the 42 school network officially updated its core curriculum worldwide with new projects replacing some of the old ones.

I hope to complete 42's core curriculum in 2026, so I have been attending the campus on weekdays for hours. However, there is still uncertainly for if that goal would be achieved, given the fact that 42's peer-to-peer education model, our progress can be affected by how active our fellow students are to attend their study at the campus.

## Moving to a New House

A major event my family and I are looking forward to in 2026, is moving to a new house. The new house will still be in the same city, but in a different residential area.

For more than three decades, the house I am living in right now has been my home since I was born. The only time I was living somewhere else for an extended period of time was me living in a condominium that served as a student hostel, when I was studying in a private university in a different state.

However, my parents eventually considered moving to a new smaller house, as they are getting old, thus having less energy to take care of every corner in our semi-detached house. Earlier in 2025, my parents purchased a new terraced house, located in a new residential area in our city. Said residential area is currently still under construction, but the construction is estimated to complete in 2026. We have also been window shopping furniture to get ideas for what furniture we want in our new house.

While I would be lying if I said I will not miss my current old house, since after all I have been living here for more than three decades, I am looking forward to our new house.
