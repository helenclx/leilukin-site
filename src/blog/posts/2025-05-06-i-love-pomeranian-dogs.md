I have been a dog lover throughout my life. Both my parents, and my father's side of the family, have decades of experience with raising dogs, so I grew up with dogs as pets in my home as well.

That said, my favourite dog breeds include one that my family had never raised â€” Pomeranian dogs.

I have always loved cute things and creatures, and Pomeranian dogs very much fit the description of cuteness, with their small sizes and foxy face, though what makes Pomeranians stand out is their long, fluffy coat.

Encountering fictional Pomeranian dog characters has certainly helped to endear me to them more, notably [Missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_(Ghost_Trick)) from the video game [{{ cite "Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective" }}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Trick:_Phantom_Detective), as well as [Barkley](https://wiki.cassettebeasts.com/wiki/Barkley) and [Pombomb](https://wiki.cassettebeasts.com/wiki/Pombomb) from the video game [{{ cite "Cassette Beasts" }}](https://www.cassettebeasts.com/). In fact, Missile, who is my favourite character in {{ cite "Ghost Trick" }}, can be credited for making me interested in Pomeranians in the first place. {{ cite "Cassette Beasts" }} is [my favourite video game ever](/shrines/cassettebeasts/), and I would be lying if I said it having Pomeranian characters does not help with that, especially given that Pombomb is my favourite monster species in the game to the extent that I [bought an official plushie](2023-10-13-my-cassette-beasts-pombomb-plushie-arrived.md) of it, and had it shipped all the way from the United States to Malaysia.

Unfortunately, I have never had the chance of actually seeing a Pomeranian dog in person... until one day when I attended [42 the computer science school's bootcamp](2025-05-04-42-piscine-completed.md).

On April 16, I was just about to leave my local campus of 42 and return home after finishing my school work for the day. Outside the building, someone was walking their dog. When the person and their dog were approaching my direction, I had a good look at the pup, who turned out to be none other than a Pomeranian!

Words could not even begin to describe how delighted and grateful I was for finally having the opportunity to see a Pomeranian for myself for the first time in my life, after having been fascinated by those adorable, small and fluffy pups for years. Naturally, beholding one up close made me appreciate them even more.
