\[Originally posted on [Deadly Stream forums](https://deadlystream.com/topic/9541-tslrcm-m4-78ep-modules-warp-codes-music-overview/)\]

In 2017, modder Kexikus created a spreadsheet to list all of [The first Knights of the Old Republic game's modules and their corresponding Day, Night and Battle music](https://deadlystream.com/topic/5101-k1-music-overview-and-warp-code-list/). Sith Holocron, who is also a modder, requested a Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords version of such list, though none of the sort has been made, so I decided to volunteer the task myself.

Here you go:

[The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod (TSLRCM) + M4-78 Enhancement Project (M4-78EP) modules and music overview spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HWJaCCIEiDVQxDDBjJ0jRWK1mUydoDdc7p7NdtRGdPQ/edit#gid=0)

This spreadsheet covers all the modules from both TSLRCM and M4-78EP. Like in K1, the module codes can be used for the warp cheat code (for example, warp 003EBO).

All music tracks are listed with their number corresponding to their row in ambientmusic.2da, their file name (the music files can be found in the StreamMusic folder) and their track title as identified with their TLK (dialog.tlk) StrRef. I have also included previews of the music by linking to YouTube in the spreadsheet.

Hope you will find this spreadsheet helpful. Enjoy!
