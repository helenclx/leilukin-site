{% container "article", "content__section" %}
Welcome to Leilukin’s {% cite "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords" %} Mod Build!
mos
Here I am compiling a list of all the modifications, or mods in short, that I use for {% cite "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords" %} ({% cite "KotOR 2" %}), the single-player role-playing video game set in the {% cite "Star Wars" %} universe video game developed by Obsidian Entertainment and sequel to {% cite "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic" %}, for the best experience with the game. This document is made for my reference and to share with others.

In order to prevent mod conflicts as much as possible, installation order matters a lot if you are using many mods for the {% cite "KotOR" %} games. Therefore, the full list of my mod build below has been arranged in the proper installation order to make these mods compatible. If you are interested in following my mod build, you should install the mods in the order you are presented with them. Also, when you install the mods according to my build, overwrite any files when prompted.

I own {% cite "KotOR 2" %} on both Steam and GOG. I play the Steam version of {% cite "KotOR 2" %} with the Aspyr update.

The format of this mod list is inspired by [KOTOR Community Portal's mod lists](https://kotor.neocities.org/modding/).

## Important Things About This Mod Build

Important things to keep in mind about my {% cite "KotOR 2" %} mod build:

1. ALL the mods included in my {% cite "KotOR 2" %} mod build are compatible with The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod (TSLRCM). I consider TSLRCM a mandatory mod for {% cite "KotOR 2" %} that not only I can never play {% cite "KotOR 2" %} without it, I suggest everyone who plays {% cite "KotOR 2" %} on PC should at least have one complete playthrough with TSLRCM installed. Therefore, a {% cite "KotOR 2" %} mod must be compatible with TSLRCM to be considered for inclusion in my mod build.

2. My {% cite "KotOR 2" %} mod build may not be compatible with M4-78 Enhancement Project (M4-78EP). I have played M4-78EP for a few playthroughs but honestly, I find the mod very tedious after multiple playthroughs, so I do not play {% cite "KotOR 2" %} with M4-78EP any more, and I definitely do not recommend M4-78EP for players who play KotOR 2 or TSLRCM for the first time.

3. My {% cite "KotOR 2" %} mod build is NOT compatible with the Steam Workshop. Frankly, the Steam Workshop is terrible for modding the {% cite "KotOR" %} games and a mod compatibility nightmare for the {% cite "KotOR" %} games. I strongly recommend reading Snigaroo's post on Deadly Stream on [why Steam Workshop is NOT recommended for modding {% cite "KotOR" %}](https://deadlystream.com/topic/7321-why-not-to-use-the-steam-workshop/). Therefore, I do not use nor support the Steam Workshop, and I do not wish any of my mods to be uploaded to the Steam Workshop.  If you are interested in following my KotOR 2 mod build, DO NOT use the Steam Workshop version of the mods listed below.

### Improved Widescreen Experience

Mod Name

: Tier 1 - Essential

### The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod

Mod Name
: [The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/578-tsl-restored-content-mod/) (TSLRCM)

Mod Author
: zbyl2, DarthStoney, Hassat Hunter & VarsityPuppet

Category
: Restored content & Bugfix & Immersion

Tier
: Tier 0 - Mandatory

Leilukin’s Comment
: The single most important and must-have mod for {% cite "KotOR 2" %}. If you play {% cite "KotOR 2" %} on a device where you can install mods into the game, I absolutely do not recommend playing {% cite "KotOR 2" %} without TSLRCM. I would even say your {% cite "KotOR 2" %} experience will not be complete without TSLRCM. Therefore, TSLRCM deserves the honour of being ranked as TIer 0, which is above Tier 1.

Repeat this process with the file `N_Duros03`, creating two copies and naming them `N_Duros05.tga `and `N_Duros06.tga`. When you move all the files to the override, you should be moving eight total.

Tier
: Tier 2 - Very Important

Compatibility Note
: While this mod is [confirmed by Deadly Stream](https://deadlystream.com/topic/8547-inquiries-on-mod-compatibility-list-for-tslrcm-186/) to work with TSLRCM, and the mod can indeed be used alongside TSLRCM without any game-breaking issue, if you install Remote Tells Influence on top of TSLRCM, the Remote would not have voiceover outside the Ebon Hawk (a feature added by TSLRCM since version 1.8).
: If you want to enjoy both Remote’s VO outside the Ebon Hawk and the benefits of Remote Tells influence, [I have made a patch that you can download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/af3h6y793f3zjxq/Remote%20Tells%20Influence%20Patch%20for%20TSLRCM.zip?dl=0).

Leilukin’s Comment
: This mod is especially recommended for players who want to keep track of each party member’s Influence to unlock all the Influence rewards from the party members. Irecommend checking out these influence guides:

Installation Note
: I don’t install the `store_daraala.utm` file and the UTI files with the movie characters.

Leilukin’s Comment
: This mod is essential because I never liked the design of the Jedi Master robes in vanilla. That said, I don’t install the files that add the robes of certain Star Wars movie characters in the game, as I find it very immersion-breaking to see the KotOR games directly mention characters that do not even exist at the time period until about 4000 years later.

Given the fact that official materials of {% cite "Star Wars Legends" %} after the release of {% cite "KotOR 2" %} established that the Exile is female and light side, and she travels with both Handmaiden and Disciple, PartySwap is one of the best things that ever happened to {% cite "KotOR 2" %}.

## Final Note

In addition to the mods above, I also use some reskins of my character that were for personal use only.

Since I play {% cite "KotOR 2" %} with the Aspyr patch, so the game can run smoothly on my PC, I also install [ShaderOverride](https://github.com/HappyFunTimes01/ShaderOverride) to fix the fog issue with the Aspyr patch. You can find a step-by-step instruction in [a KotOR subreddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/kotor/comments/67578l/comment/dgp1r6w/):

1. [Download this `opengl32.dll` file](https://github.com/HappyFunTimes01/ShaderOverride/blob/master/Release/opengl32.dll) and put it into your {% cite "KotOR 2" %} root folder.
2. Start the game.
3. You should now have two folders called `shaders_original` and `shadow_override` in your KOTOR folder.
4. Go into the `shaders_original` folder and open the first file with a program like Notepad++.
5. Locate the line that says "MOV result.color, r0" (second to last line usually).
6. Right above that line paste the content of the [quote under "Fog Issue" that starts with PARAM p =...](https://github.com/HappyFunTimes01/ShaderOverride/blob/master/README.md). [Your file should look like this screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/QeAODN4.png).
7. Repeat this step for every text file in the folder that has the MOV result.color, r0 line. That can take some time and there might be ways to automate the process but explaining it might take so long that you're probably just better off doing the whole thing manually.
8. After you pasted this into every file that has the MOV result.color, r0 line near the end, copy all text files into the shader\_override folder.
9. Launch the game, the fog should now be fixed.
