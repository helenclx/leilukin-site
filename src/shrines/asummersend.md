## How I Discovered {% cite "A Summer’s End — Hong Kong 1986" %}

![Key art of A Summer’s End — Hong Kong 1986](/assets/shrines/asummersend/images/ASE_Key_art_main.avif)

I first learned about {% cite "A Summer’s End — Hong Kong 1986" %} through [Linux Game Consortium](https://linuxgameconsortium.com/a-summers-end-hong-kong-1986-just-announced/), a Linux gaming news website. There was a period where I set up my gaming laptop to dual boot Windows 10 and Linux, so I ended up following Linux gaming news for a while. While Windows is still my main platform for gaming, the discovery of {% cite "A Summer’s End" %} was the biggest unexpected benefit and surprise when I tried out Linux.

As a lesbian, the premise of a visual novel about a sapphic romance already caught my interest, but what urged me to play it even more was the Hong Kong setting, which made my interest in the game personal, since I am a Cantonese-speaking Chinese lesbian who grew up with Hong Kong media. Not to mention, it is rare to see a fiction that tells of a sapphic love story that takes place in Hong Kong.

## Why {% cite "A Summer’s End — Hong Kong 1986" %} Means a Great Deal to Me

As a Chinese lesbian who speaks Cantonese and had engaged with a lot of Hong Kong media during my teenage years, {% cite "A Summer’s End — Hong Kong 1986" %} is the lesbian story that I relate to and feel represented the most.

I relate to both the protagonists, Michelle and Sam, as their characters represent different parts of my life as a Chinese lesbian. I also relate to the story's theme of hoping for the future of our homeland despite the political uncertainties.

My standards for lesbian representation in media has also become much higher because of this visual novel, since {% cite "A Summer’s End" %} is also a perfect example of how some of the best representations of minority groups are actually found in media made by indie creators, especially those who are part of those minority groups, so we shouldn't rely on mainstream media for representation especially when big name media companies are going to just give us scraps.

If you ask me to list just one piece of queer art that means everything to me, that gives me comfort, inspiration, and strength the most, {% cite "A Summer’s End" %} would be it.

I seriously cannot recommend {% cite "A Summer’s End" %} enough, especially for Asian sapphic women.

(I also posted this section of text as my review of {% cite "A Summer’s End" %} on Steam, and [received a lot of support](/blog/posts/2023-10-30-support-for-my-steam-review-of-a-summers-end) for it)
