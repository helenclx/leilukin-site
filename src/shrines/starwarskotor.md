## Welcome to My {{ cite "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic" }} Shrine!

![Cover art compilation of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic series](/assets/shrines/starwarskotor/images/swkotor-header.avif)

{{ cite "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic" }} ({{ cite "KotOR" }}) is a space opera role-playing video game series. The series takes place in the fictional universe of {{ cite "Star Wars" }}, with the story taking place approximately 4,000 years before the rise of the Galactic Empire.

The first title was developed by BioWare while the second ({{ cite "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords" }}) was done by Obsidian Entertainmenr. Both games were published by LucasArts. The {{ cite "KotOR" }} series also includes a subsequent new comic book series. Both comic series were published by Dark Horse Comics and act as prequels to the video games.

## My History with the {{ cite "KotOR" }} Series

I had been a {{ cite "Star Wars" }} fan since I was 13 in 2005 after watching {{ cite "Revenge of the Sith" }} in cinema. However, I was not aware of the existence of the {{ cite "Knights of the Old Republic" }} video game series until around 2010, after seeing other {{ cite "Star Wars" }} fans on Baidu Tieba talked about those games. I started playing the first {{ cite "KotOR" }} game in early 2011, immediately followed by {{ cite "KotOR 2" }}, and the series has been one of my special interests ever since.

I was hooked immediately to the {{ cite "KotOR" }} series when I played them. The first {{ cite "KotOR" }} game was the first Western RPG I had played. I was drawn to the games' story and characters and the games' focus on them, since the {{ cite "KotOR" }} series was also the most story-heavy games I played at the time. KotOR was also the first video game I played where you can pursue a romance with a character, which was a concept that blew my young mind at the time, because before {{ cite "KotOR" }}, I thought a romance between your player character and an NPC you like could only exist in imagination via shipping or fanfiction.

My investment in the {{ cite "KotOR" }} series has evolved over time, leading to me learning to mod the games and become a modder.

## My History with {{ cite "KotOR" }} Modding

I began to use and get interested in {{ cite "KotOR" }} mods since the mid-2010s, in no small part thanks to [The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod (TSLRCM)](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/578-tsl-restored-content-mod/), which is widely regarded as an essential mod for the best experience with {{ cite "KotOR 2" }}, as the game's rushed development led to many contents being cut from the game. This led me to discover more {{ cite "KotOR" }} mods hosted on [Deadly Stream](https://deadlystream.com/), which include the developers of TSLRCM, and [GameFront](https://www.gamefront.com/).

In the mid-2010s, the {{ cite "KotOR" }} fan circle I was involved in on Tumblr also included modders, who inspired me to learn to create mods myself. I did not have any programming exprience when I started learning modding {{ cite "KotOR" }}, so it took practice to learn and understand the modding tutorials on Deadly Stream and the now-defunct LucasForums (R.I.P.).

The very first {{ cite "KotOR" }} mod I created was [TSL Improved Party Outfits](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1012-tsl-improved-party-outfits/) in 2015, though initially I only meant it for personal use, until I released it to the public on 4 February 2017. The first {{ cite "KotOR" }} mod I released to the public was [Visas Marr and Female Exile Romance](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/968-visas-marr-and-female-exile-romance/) on 15 December 2016.

Making same-gender romance mods for {{ cite "KotOR 2" }} was the primary motivation for me to make and release {{ cite "KotOR" }} mods myself. I was immensely frustrated by the total lack of same-gender romance mods for any of the {{ cite "KotOR 2" }} characters, and every other LGBTQ+ {{ cite "KotOR" }} fans I have interacted with on Tumblr share the same sentiment. Therefore, I decided to stop waiting for {{ cite "KotOR 2" }} same-gender romance mods to happen, and be the change myself.

To my great satisfication, my same-gender romance mods have been well-received, with fellow LGBTQ+ players expressing gratitude for their existence. My [Handmaiden and Female Exile - Disciple and Male Exile Romance](https://deadlystream.com/forum/files/file/977-handmaiden-and-female-exile-disciple-and-male-exile-romance/) mod would go on to win the [Mod of the Year 2017](https://deadlystream.com/topic/5983-mod-of-the-year-results/) award on Deadly Stream.

Furthermore, for my work in making same-gender romance mods for the {{ cite "KotoR" }} games, I was [interviewed by Ars Technica](/featured/kotor2-modder-interview-ars-technica) and mentioned in [A More Civilized Age: A Star Wars Podcast](/featured/a-more-civilized-age-ep-110).

I love modding the {{ cite "KotOR" }} games, not only because the games are a special interest of mine, but also I love creating things for my interests. Modifying the games made me feel like I have the power to change the game to make them better and more enjoyable, and thus improve my experience with playing the games.

You can check out all the {{ cite "KotOR" }} mods I have created, including [{{ cite "KotOR 1" }} mods](/projects/videogamemods/kotor1) and [{{ cite "KotOR 2" }} mods](/projects/videogamemods/kotor2), on my main site's [Projects](/projects/#my-video-game-mods) pages.
