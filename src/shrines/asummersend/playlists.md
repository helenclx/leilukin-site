{% cite "A Summer’s End — Hong Kong 1986" %} is a gold mine of music. Not only that the visual novel has a great soundtrack (its [official soundtrack](https://www.asummersend.com/original-soundtrack) was released on August 21, 2020), but the developer Oracle and Bone has also compiled playlists related to the game.

As a tribute to {% cite "A Summer’s End" %}, I have also created a fanmix myself.

## Sam's Mixtape

Compiled by Oracle and Bone, Sam’s Mixtape A-Side and B-Side are playlists of the songs that Sam was listening to on the first day she met Michelle.
