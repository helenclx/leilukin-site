A Summer’s End — Hong Kong 1986 is a gold mine of music. Not only that the visual novel has a great soundtrack (its [official soundtrack](https://www.asummersend.com/original-soundtrack) was released on August 21, 2020), but the developer Oracle and Bone has also compiled playlists related to the game.

As a tribute to A Summer's End, I have also created a fanmix myself.

## Sam's Mixtape

Compiled by Oracle and Bone, Sam’s Mixtape A-Side and B-Side are playlists of the songs that Sam was listening to on the first day she met Michelle.

## 夏日戀人 (Summer Lover)

Oracle and Bone compiled this playlist as a tribute to Anita Mui, who was a major inspiration for A Summer’s End — Hong Kong 1986.

## My Dear Summer Lover

My fanmix for A Summer’s End — Hong Kong 1986, dedicated to Sam and Michelle’s love story.

This mix contains mostly Cantonese and English songs, with one Mandarin song. Majority of these songs were performed by Hong Kong artists and released in the 80s, because A Summer’s End took place in Hong Kong and in the 80s.

I have carefully selected and arranged these tracks, so the lyrics would reflect Sam and Michelle’s relationship development throughout A Summer’s End. Therefore, the content of this mix could be considered spoilers if you have not played the visual novel.

Since Oracle and Bone has cited Anita Mui as a major inspiration for them and this visual novel, I have also included multiple songs performed by Anita Mui in this mix. Because A Summer’s End is a lesbian story, when I was choosing which songs to include in this mix, I also prioritize songs that were performed by women artists.
