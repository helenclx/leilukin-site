{% cite "A Summer’s End — Hong Kong 1986" %} was lovingly crafted by its developer Oracle and Bone with gorgeous art, so i want to make a page dedicated to my appreciation for the visual novel’s art.

The game has an in-game gallery that gradually unlocks as you progress the story, though certain scene art only unlocks if you pick certain dialogue options. Check out [Dialog Choices Guide (AKA Lesbianism 101)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2072736837) on Steam for how to unlock all scenes, and thus the entire in-game gallery.

I also highly recommend checking out the [official site](https://www.asummersend.com/) of {% cite "A Summer’s End" %} and the social media accounts of Oracle and Bone's for more beauriful art about the visual novel!

## Passion Patch Screenshots

{% cite "A Summer’s End — Hong Kong 1986" %} offers an optional adult content patch, also referred to as Passion Patch, to the game. [Installation guide for the patch](https://www.asummersend.com/game-manual-installation-guide) can be found on the official website.

I had played {% cite "A Summer’s End" %} with the Passion Patch enabled and unlocked all scenes from the patch by referring to the [Dialog Choices Guide (AKA Lesbianism 101)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2072736837) on Steam.

The sex scenes between Sam and Michelle added by the Passion Patch are easily the best sapphic sex scenes I have ever seen in any game. Furthermore, Oracle and Bone had written a blog post about their thought process behind the [sexual content in {% cite "A Summer’s End" %}](https://www.asummersend.com/blog/sexual-content). Therefore, I want to dedicate this section to screenshots of these scenes.
