## Attending 42 the Computer Science School

From April 7 to May 2, I attended my local campus of the [42 computer science school](https://www.42network.org/), by participating in their 26-day bootcamp named the Piscine. On 16 May 2025, I was informed that I succeed in passing the Piscine and am eligible for 42's core curriculum. Currently, I am waiting for 42's core curriculum to begin on October 6.

You can read more about my life at 42 the computer science school in my blog posts under the ["42 the school"](/topics/42-the-school/) category.
