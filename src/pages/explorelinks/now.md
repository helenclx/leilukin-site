## Attended 42 the Computer Science School

From April 7 to May 2, I attended a Malaysian campus of the [42 computer science school](https://www.42network.org/), by participating in their 26-day bootcamp named the Piscine. On 16 May 2025, I was informed that I succeed in passing the Piscine and is eligible for 42's core curriculum.

You can read more about my life at 42 the computer science school in my blog posts under the ["42 the school"](/topics/42-the-school/) category.
