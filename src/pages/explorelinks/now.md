## Participating in freeCodeCamp Summer 2025 Hackathon

## Attending 42 the Computer Science School

From April 7 to May 2, I attended a Malaysian campus of the [42 computer science school](https://www.42network.org/), by participating in their 26-day bootcamp named the Piscine. On 16 May 2025, I was informed that I succeed in passing the Piscine and is eligible for 42's core curriculum. Currently, I am waiting for 42's core curriculum to begin.

You can read more about my life at 42 the computer science school in my blog posts under the ["42 the school"](/topics/42-the-school/) category.

## Switched to Using Linux Full-Time

In June 2025, I spent around two weeks in preparing for and setting up my official migration from Windows to Linux desktop, and become a full-time Linux user. On 22 June, I finally made the switch by installing Fedora Linux on my 7-year-old gaming laptop, fulling replacing Windows.

You can read more about my transition to a full-time Linux user on my blog post, ["I am Officially a Full-Time Linux User"](/blog/posts/2025-06-27-migrate-linux-full-time/).
