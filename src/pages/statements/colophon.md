## JavaScript

Due to this website being a static site, JavaScript is used to create dynamic and interactive components of this site. Here is a list of how JavaScript is used on this site:

* The header of every page uses JavaScript to detect the visitor's current date, so the header will display a top blurb and in some cases also changes the header background on certain dates, including:
    * LGBTQ+ events, International Women's Day, Disability Pride Month, website anniversary and my birthday;
    * Release anniversaries of media with dedicated shrines, including:
        * [{{ cite "A Summer’s End — Hong Kong 1986" }}](/shrines/asummersend)
        * [{{ cite "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic" }}](/shrines/starwarskotor)
        * [{{ cite "Cassette Beasts" }}](/shrines/cassettebeasts)
        * [{{ cite "Pokémon Omega Ruby" }} and {{ cite "Alpha Sapphire" }}](/shrines/pokemonoras)
    * Birthdays of characters from {{ cite "A Summer’s End — Hong Kong 1986" }} on its shrine.
* Add buttons to copy code snippets to pages with code blocks.
* Scott O'Hara's [ARIA Tooltips](https://github.com/scottaohara/a11y_tooltips) script is used to implement accessible tooltips that meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 success criterion for [1.4.13: Content on Hover or Focus (Level AA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/content-on-hover-or-focus.html), by allowing visitors to see tooltips on keyboard focus and dismiss tooltips by pressing the Escape key.
* Zach Leatherman's [details-utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zachleat/details-utils) JavaScript package is used to automatically expand sidebar table of contents on wide screens.
* [status.cafe](https://status.cafe/) widget, which is placed on the home page, uses JavaScript to fetch data of my latest status update.
* [Website Carbon Badge](https://www.websitecarbon.com/badge/), which is placed on the home page, uses JavaScript to calculate the carbon footprint of this website.
* [Joined page](/joined) includes webring widgets that use JavaScript.
* [Guestbook](/guestbook) uses JavaScript to render a form, send form data to my private Discord channel via Discord webhook, and fetch data from Google Sheets to display messages on the web page (guestbook code by [Vera Konigin](https://groundedwren.neocities.org/pages/controls/guestbookDemo)).
* The search form on the [Search page](/search) is powered by [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/), a static search library in JavaScript.

You can still access most of the content of this site with JavaScript disabled, but the above components will not work as intended.
