## What am I Working on

Recently, I spent a whole week in overhauling this website with the static site generator [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). The rebuilding process was [finally completed on 20 April 2023](/blog/posts/2024-04-21-april-2024-leilukins-hub-overhaul-with-eleventy/), but I am still doing maintenance and file organising under the hood.
