## What I am Working on

### Custom Domain Name and New Hosting for This Site

I finally bought a custom domain name for this website, leilukin.com. To be able to use the custom domain name without spending more money to upgrade my Neocities account to the Supporter tier, I have also been busy with setting up this site to be hosted on Netlify.

### Updating my {% cite "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic" %} mods

As part of my ongoing collaboration with [KOtOR Community Portal's mod builds](https://kotor.neocities.org/modding/), recently I have updated [KotOR 1 Twi'lek Male NPC Diversity](/projects/kotor1mods/#kotor-1-twilek-male-npc-diversity) and [PartySwap](/projects/kotor2mods/#partyswap) to ensure my mods are bug-free and compatible with other mods in the mod builds, and to prepare for the next iteration of the mod builds.
