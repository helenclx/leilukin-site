## Migrating Leilukin's Hub and Its Subsites to Hostinger

Starting with 25 July 2024, Leilukin's Hub and all its subsites, including its [tumbleblog](https://tumbleblog.leilukin.com/) and [fanlisting collective](https://fan.leilukin.com/), have been migrated to [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.my/).

You can read my blog post, [Leilukin's Hub Has Migrated to Hostinger](/blog/posts/2024-07-27-hostinger-migration-leilukins-hub), to learn more.

## Participating in Personal Web Spaces

I have been making a more active effort in participating in personal web spaces and connecting with other webmasters, through various methods including leaving messages on others' guestbooks, sending other webmasters emails, linking to each other's websites, following each other's Neocities profiles, etc.

Furthermore, I joined [32-Bit Cafe](https://32bit.cafe/) on both its Discourse forum and Discord on 15 June 2024, and earned the [New Member of the Month for June 2024](https://tumbleblog.leilukin.com/2024/07/02/earned-32-bit-cafe-new-member-of-the-month-award-for-june-2024/) on the Discourse forum.
