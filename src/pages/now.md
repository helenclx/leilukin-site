## Participating in Personal Web Spaces

I have been making a more active effort in participating in personal web spaces and connecting with other webmasters, through various methods including leaving messages on others' guestbooks, sending other webmasters emails, linking to each other's websites, following each other's Neocities profiles, etc.

Furthermore, I joined [32-Bit Cafe](https://32bit.cafe/) on both its Discourse forum and Discord on 15 June 2024.

## What I am Working on

### Building a {% cite "Cassette Beasts" %} Fanlisting and My Fanlisting Collective

[The Fanlistings Network](https://thefanlistings.org/) has [approved my application to build and run a {% cite "Cassette Beasts" %} fanlisting](/blog/posts/2024-06-24-cassette-beasts-fanlisting-approved). so I am working on building the {% cite "Cassette Beasts" %} fanlisting and my fanlisting colellective to gather all fanlistings I own, join and have applied in one place.

### Updating my {% cite "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic" %} mods

As part of my collaboration with [KOtOR Community Portal's mod builds](https://kotor.neocities.org/modding/), I have updated [KotOR 1 Twi'lek Male NPC Diversity](/projects/kotor1mods/#kotor-1-twilek-male-npc-diversity), [PartySwap](/projects/kotor2mods/#partyswap) and [PartySwap and Extended Enclave Compatibility Patch](/projects/kotor2mods/#partyswap-and-extended-enclave-compatibility-patch) to ensure my mods are bug-free and compatible with other mods in the mod builds, and to prepare for the next iteration of the mod builds.
