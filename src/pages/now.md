## What I am Working on

### Custom Domain Name and New Hosting for This Site

I finally bought a custom domain name for this website, `leilukin.com`. To be able to use the custom domain name without spending more money to upgrade my Neocities account to the Supporter tier, I have also been busy with setting up this site to be hosted on Netlify.

For more information, read my blog post: [Custom Domain Name and Hosting Change for Leilukin's Hub](/blog/posts/2024-05-31-domain-name-hosting-change-leilukins-hub).

### Updating my {% cite "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic" %} mods

As part of my ongoing collaboration with [KOtOR Community Portal's mod builds](https://kotor.neocities.org/modding/), recently I have updated [KotOR 1 Twi'lek Male NPC Diversity](/projects/kotor1mods/#kotor-1-twilek-male-npc-diversity), [PartySwap](/projects/kotor2mods/#partyswap) and [PartySwap and Extended Enclave Compatibility Patch](/projects/kotor2mods/#partyswap-and-extended-enclave-compatibility-patch) to ensure my mods are bug-free and compatible with other mods in the mod builds, and to prepare for the next iteration of the mod builds.
