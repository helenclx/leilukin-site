        <h2>The Site</h2>

        <p>This website serves as a personal hub for my interests and self-expression, as well as my own corner on the internet outside social media platforms.</p>

        <p>On this site, you can find various stuff and resources I have created or compiled, as well as articles dedicated to my interests.</p>

        <p>While the primary purpose of this website is my own space of self-expression, I also want my website to be accessible to viewers. Therefore, I strive to design this website to be mobile-friendly and accessible to provide the best user experience with my site.</p>

        <p>Feel free to drop a message and say hi on <a href="https://leilukin.123guestbook.com/" target="_blank">my guestbook</a>!</p>

        <p>You can link to my website with this button:</p>

            <site-btn></site-btn>
        {% endrenderTemplate %}
