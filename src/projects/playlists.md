## My Dear Summer Lover

![A playlist cover image made of Sam and Michelle from A Summer's End being close to kissing, with the title 'My Dear Summer Lover: A Sam x Michelle Fanmix'](/assets/projects/playlists/My-Dear-Summer-Lover-cover.png)

A fanmix for the visual novel <cite>[A Summer’s End — Hong Kong 1986](https://www.asummersend.com/home)</cite>, dedicated to Sam and Michelle’s love story.

This mix contains mostly Cantonese and English songs, with one Mandarin song. Majority of these songs were performed by Hong Kong artists and released in the 80s, because A Summer’s End took place in Hong Kong and in the 80s.

I have carefully selected and arranged these tracks, so the lyrics would reflect Sam and Michelle’s relationship development throughout A Summer’s End. Therefore, the content of this mix could be considered spoilers if you have not played the visual novel.

Since Oracle and Bone has cited Anita Mui as a major inspiration for them and this visual novel, I have also included multiple songs performed by Anita Mui in this mix. Because A Summer’s End is a lesbian story, when I was choosing which songs to include in this mix, I also prioritize songs that were performed by women artists.

Collection of Mandarin queer anthems.

I made this playlist after discovering Wikipedia's list of Chinese queer anthems on [its Mandarin article for Gay Anthem (同志國歌)](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%90%8C%E5%BF%97%E5%9C%8B%E6%AD%8C#%E8%8F%AF%E8%AA%9E).
