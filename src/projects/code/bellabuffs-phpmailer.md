## New Features
* Integrate PHPMailer for the email sending features, should the fanlisting owner enables these features
* Email sending features are enabled by default, but can be disabled in `prefs.php`
* HTML5 form validation, including E-mail and URL input types and the `required` attribute
* Update list of countries
* Add a buttons folder (with a placeholder file to enable the folder to be pushed via Git), so users do not need to manually create the folder to store uploaded buttons
