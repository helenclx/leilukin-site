## Important Note for Steam Users

If you play KotOR 2 on Steam, I **DO NOT recommend using the Steam Workshop to mod KotOR 2 at all**, especially if you want to use any of my mods. I recommend reading this post on [why NOT to use the Steam Workshop](https://deadlystream.com/topic/7321-why-not-to-use-the-steam-workshop/).

The sheer amount of mod compatibility issues the Steam Workshop can cause to KotOR 2 mods is precisely why **I will *never* upload any of my KotOR 2 mods to Steam Workshop**.

## Same-Gender Romances
