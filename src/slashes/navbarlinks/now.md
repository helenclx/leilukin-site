## Celebrating Lunar New Year

2025's Lunar New Year takes place in late January, so as a Chinese person, I am currently celebrating it. You can read my blog post ["My 2025 Lunar New Year"](/blog/posts/2025-02-06-my-2025-lunar-new-year) to learn how I celebrate Lunar New Year this year.

Happy Year of the Snake!

## Planning on Attending the 42 Computer Science School

I have been planning on attending a Malaysian campus of the [42 computer science school](https://www.42network.org/). I have registered, passed their online game test and will join their trial bootcamp known as the Piscine beginning on 7 April 2025.

You can read more about it on the blog post ["Attending 42 the Computer Science School"](/blog/posts/2025-01-19-attending-42-school).
