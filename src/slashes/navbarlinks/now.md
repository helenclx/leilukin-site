## Diagnosed with Retinitis Pigmentosa

On 30 November 2024, I was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Therefore, I have written [an article about living with the genetic eye disease](/articles/living-with-retinitis-pigmentosa) that causes gradual vision loss.

## Participating in Personal Web Spaces

I have been making a more active effort in participating in personal web spaces and connecting with other webmasters, through various methods including leaving messages on others' guestbooks, sending other webmasters emails, linking to each other's websites, following each other's Neocities profiles, etc.

Furthermore, I joined [32-Bit Cafe](https://32bit.cafe/) on both its Discourse forum and Discord on 15 June 2024, and earned the [New Member of the Month for June 2024](https://tumbleblog.leilukin.com/2024/07/02/earned-32-bit-cafe-new-member-of-the-month-award-for-june-2024/) on the Discourse forum.
