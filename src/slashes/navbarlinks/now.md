## Working My Last Month in My First Web Developer Job

Unfortunately, my first web developer job that started in August 2024 ended up only lasting for four months. I did not pass my probation, so 3 January 2025 was the finaly day of my first web developer job.

For more details, see my blog post: ["Leaving My First Developer Job"](/blog/posts/2024-12-16-leaving-my-first-developer-job)

## Planning on Attending the 42 Computer Science School

Since it was confirmed that I will no longer continue my first web developer job for long, I have been planning on attending a Malaysian campus of the [42 computer science school](https://www.42network.org/). I have registered, passed their online game test and will join their trial bootcamp known as the Piscine in March.
