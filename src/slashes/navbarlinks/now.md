## Attending the 42 Computer Science School

I am attending a Malaysian campus of the [42 computer science school](https://www.42network.org/). I have registered, passed their online game test and am currently in their 26-daybootcamp known as the Piscine beginning on 7 April 2025.

You can read more about it on my plans for attending 42 in the blog post, ["Attending 42 the Computer Science School"](/blog/posts/2025-01-19-attending-42-school).

## Switching to Vim and Neovim from Visual Studio Code as My Main Code Editor

Visual Studio Code had been my main code editor for two years, since I started to teach myself web development, but I have switched to Neovim (with [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)'s setup) as my main code editor.

You can read more about the switch in my blog post, ["I Use (Neo)Vim BTW"](/blog/posts/2025-04-03-i-use-neovim-btw/).
