## Officially Became a Professional Web Developer

Starting from 16 August 2024, I am officially a professional web developer now! I owe much to this very website for inspiring me to pursue web development as a profession.

You can read more about my journey from a hobbyist to professional web developer in my blog post, ["From Hobbyist to Professional Web Developer"](/blog/posts/2024-08-18-from-hobbyist-to-professional-web-developer).

Therefore, my new job has been a major focus of mine currently, so I could hopefully pass my probation period.

## Participating in Personal Web Spaces

I have been making a more active effort in participating in personal web spaces and connecting with other webmasters, through various methods including leaving messages on others' guestbooks, sending other webmasters emails, linking to each other's websites, following each other's Neocities profiles, etc.

Furthermore, I joined [32-Bit Cafe](https://32bit.cafe/) on both its Discourse forum and Discord on 15 June 2024, and earned the [New Member of the Month for June 2024](https://tumbleblog.leilukin.com/2024/07/02/earned-32-bit-cafe-new-member-of-the-month-award-for-june-2024/) on the Discourse forum. On 8 June 2024, I wrote and submitted my article, ["How I (Tried to) Implement Accessible Footnotes"](/articles/accessible-footnotes), to 32-Bit Cafe's Community Code Jam #5: [Back to School](https://32bit.cafe/~xandra/events/codejam5/).
