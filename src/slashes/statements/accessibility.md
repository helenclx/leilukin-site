Even though this website is primarily meant to be my own space of self-expression, I also want every visitor to my website to have the best possible experience of browsing my website. Accessibility is also relevant to me as a disabled and neurodivergent person.

Therefore, I strive to design my website to be accessible, including to fellow disabled and neurodivergent people, by aiming to meet [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) Level AA standards.

## Accessibility Features

High-level overview of the accessibility features of this site:

* Responsive design and mobile-friendly layout.
* Semantic HTML, enhanced by Web Accessibility Initiative – Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA).
* Sufficient colour contrast between text and background colours.
* Alt text for all non-decorative images, occasionally accompanied with longer image descriptions.
* Keyboard navigation-friendly: Every interactive element can be focused and interacted with keyboard buttons, with visible outline when focused.
* Logical content and heading flow.
* Links to skip to the main content or the top of the page.
* Sufficient font size that can be enlarged without breaking the site layout
* No autoplaying audio or video.

This site uses the [Lexend](https://www.lexend.com/) font family as the default font and [Intel One Mono](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/company-overview/one-monospace-font.html) as the monospaced font to improve text readability.

## Testing

I use the following tools to test my site for accessibility:
* WebAIM's [WAVE Browser Extension](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/)
* [axe DevTools - Web Accessibility Testing](https://www.deque.com/axe/browser-extensions/) browser extension
* [Alex Clapperton's Colour Contrast Checker](https://colourcontrast.cc/)
* [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/about-nvda/) screen reader for Windows
* TalkBack screen reader for Android

In addition, I test the accessibility of my website manually by navigating with keyboard alone.

## Feedback

Feedback from disabled and neurodivergent people are welcome. You can [contact me via email](mailto:{{ sitemeta.siteAuthor.emailEncoded | safe }}) for feedbacks and suggestions for improving the accessibility of this site.
