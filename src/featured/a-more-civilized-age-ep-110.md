It was an honour and a pleasant surprise that I, my website and my queer romance mods for {{ cite "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords" }} ({{ cite "KotOR 2" }}) got mentioned in the {{ cite "Star Wars" }} podcast, [A More Civilized Age](https://amorecivilizedage.net/) (AMCA).

Specifically, in [Episode 110, "Character Creation and Repairing the Ebon Hawk (KOTOR II 01)"](https://amorecivilizedage.net/110-character-creation-and-repairing-the-ebon-hawk-kotor-ii-01), which aired on 7 May 2025, the hosts of AMCA talked about {{ cite "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords" }}, playing the game and the mods they were using. The part of the episode where I and my works got talked about was from the timestamp 01:00:12 to 01:02:00.

Just before I got mentioned, the episode also brought up [PartySwap](/projects/videogamemods/kotor2/#partyswap), another {{ cite "KotOR 2" }} mod that I am maintaining [after the original creator left the {{ cite "KotOR" }} modding scene](/shrines/starwarskotor/articles/partyswap-management-takeover/).

AMCA was not a podcast I was following, so I was not aware of them mentioning me and my works until I received a message from someone named Liam in [my guestbook](/guestbook/):

> Hi! The Star Wars podcast A More Civilized Age put me onto your work in the modding space, and I'd just like to express my gratitude for your work! I'm a big Star Wars fan and I love the KotOR games, and I think your mods really improve and deepen the relationships between the characters. Thanks again!

To which I replied:

> Hi, Liam! Thank you for your kind words and support for my KotOR mods! Thanks to your message, I learned that my queer romance mods for KotOR 2 got acknowledged by A More Civilized Age.
> 
> Character relationships are among my favourite aspects of KotOR 2, so I made the queer romance mods to allow players, especially queer players, to experience those relationship dynamics without the heterosexual gender restrictions.

I was pleased that AMCA not only acknowledged my work in queering {{ cite "KotOR 2" }} got acknowledged, but also referred to my website in both the podcast episode and [the episode's show notes about their KotOR 2 mod list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQL19chJVJBR613xUHmk9fD44Ze9bu_uCyPx4o9Oml8P19lOEK0w5f9aIjlv9PWx1sIZwk0vGnTRv-5/pub). One of the goals of me making Leilukin's Hub was to make my website the go-to method to discover my presence on the web and my works, including my mods for {{ cite "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic" }} series.

Thank you for the shout-out, A More Civilized Age!
