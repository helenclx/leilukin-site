                    <h2>How I Got into <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite></h2>

                    <img src="./img/cassettebeasts-website_screenshot_02.png" alt="Official screenshot of Cassette Beasts">

                    <p>On 30 June 2023, when the Steam Summer Sale 2023 just started, I received <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> as a Steam gift from a generous friend, who knew that I had been looking for independant monster collecting games, since I mostly play indie games instead of AAA games nowadays.</p>

                    <p>I started my first playthrough of <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> on 18 July 2023, and I was immediately hooked. I could already feel that this game has like everything I could ask for in an indie alternative to <cite>Pokémon</cite>.</p>
                        
                    <p>I ended up spending around 34 hours to beat the main campaign, and that was because I made the deliberate decision to max out the companion characters' relationship level before advancing to the final level of the main story, because this game has more focus on human characters and relationships than what you may expect in a monster-collecting game.</p>

                    <p>I love <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> so much that I also purchased its Deluxe Edition, which includes the soundtrack, the art book and the Cosplay Pack as a birthday present for myself on 28 July 2023.</p>

                    <h2>Why You Should Play <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite></h2>

                    <img src="./img/cassettebeasts-website-header-bg.jpg" alt="Header of the Cassette Beasts official website">

                    <p><cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> is a masterpiece of a monster collecting game, rivalling if not even surpassing <cite>Pokémon</cite> at its best, because while it is obvious that Cassette Beasts is inspired by <cite>Pokémon</cite>, it executes various aspects of <cite>Pokémon</cite> games with its own unique takes that are sometimes even better than <cite>Pokémon</cite>, from monster collecting mechanic, battle system, elemental type match ups, story, characters, lore, world building, map design, etc, with an amazing soundtrack that goes along with the game. As a result, <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> is perfectly capable of standing on its own.</p>

                    <p>I cannot recommend <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> enough if you like monster collecting games, including, if not especially, if you like <cite>Pokémon</cite> but want an indie alternative, or something different after finding <cite>Pokémon</cite> games getting stale or becoming jaded by the direction of the <cite>Pokémon</cite> games.</p>

                    <p>Indie monster collecting games in particular need all the support they can get to let more people know that <cite>Pokémon</cite> is not the only monster collecting game worth your attention, and <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> is one of those indie games that prove indie games can be more creative than AAA games.</p>

                    <p>If you need more convincing on how <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> is much more than a <cite>Pokémon</cite> clone, <a href="./articles/cassette-beasts-more-than-a-pokemon-clone.html">I have written a huge essay on this shrine</a>.</p>
