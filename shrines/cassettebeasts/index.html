                    <h2>Why You Should Play <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite></h2>

                    <img src="./img/cassettebeasts-website-header-bg.jpg" alt="Header of the Cassette Beasts official website">

                    <p><cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> is a masterpiece of a monster collecting game, rivalling if not even surpassing <cite>Pokémon</cite> at its best, because while it is obvious that Cassette Beasts is inspired by <cite>Pokémon</cite>, it executes various aspects of <cite>Pokémon</cite> games with its own unique takes that are sometimes even better than <cite>Pokémon</cite>, from monster collecting mechanic, battle system, elemental type match ups, story, characters, lore, world building, map design, etc, with an amazing soundtrack that goes along with the game. As a result, <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> is perfectly capable of standing on its own.</p>

                    <p>I cannot recommend <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> enough if you like monster collecting games, including, if not especially, if you like <cite>Pokémon</cite> but want an indie alternative, or something different after finding <cite>Pokémon</cite> games getting stale, or becoming jaded by the direction of the <cite>Pokémon</cite> games.</p>

                    <p>Indie monster collecting games in particular need all the support they can get to let more people know that <cite>Pokémon</cite> is not the only monster collecting game worth your attention, and <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> is one of those indie games that prove indie games can be more creative than AAA games.</p>

                    <p>If you need more convincing on how <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> is much more than a <cite>Pokémon</cite> clone, <a href="./articles/cassette-beasts-more-than-a-pokemon-clone.html">I have written a huge essay on this shrine</a>.</p>

                    <h2>My Interest In <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite></h2>

                    <img src="./img/cassettebeasts-website_screenshot_02.png" alt="Official screenshot of Cassette Beasts">

                    <p>On 30 June 2023, when the Steam Summer Sale 2023 just started, I received <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> as a Steam gift from a generous friend, who knew that I had been looking for independant monster collecting games, since I mostly play indie games instead of AAA games nowadays.</p>

                    <p>I started my first playthrough of <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> on 18 July 2023, and I was immediately hooked. I could already feel this game has everything I could ask for in an indie alternative to <cite>Pokémon</cite>.</p>

                    <p>I ended up spending around 34 hours to beat the main campaign, and that was because I made the deliberate decision to max out the companion characters' relationship level before advancing to the final portion of the main story, since this game has more focus on human characters and relationships than what you may expect in a monster-collecting game.</p>

                    <p>I love <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> so much that I also purchased its Deluxe Edition, which includes the soundtrack, the art book and the Cosplay Pack as a birthday present for myself on 28 July 2023. In addition, I also <a href="/blog/posts/2023-10-13-My-Cassette-Beasts-Pombomb-Plushie-Arrived.html" target="blank">bought the official plushie of Pombomb</a>, my favourite monster from the game.</p>

                    <p>Moreover, I ended up unlocking all 123 achievements on Steam on 13 March 2024. Very few RPGs make me want to unlock all the achievements, so it is telling how much I love <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> that I am willing to spend time and effort to work for all the achievements.</p>

                    <p><cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> not only is my Game of the Year of 2023, but also it has become my absolute favourite monster collecting game, and even my all-time favourite video game ever.</p>

                    <img src="./img/cassettebeasts-website_screenshot_07.png" alt="Official screenshot of Cassette Beasts">

                    <p>Since I got into <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite>, I have been making a great deal of effort in promoting the game online, by talking about and recommending the game on my online spaces, including this shrine on my website, as well as social media platforms such as Tumblr and Twitter.</p>

                    <p>I am involved in the <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> community by joining and participating in the <a href="https://discord.gg/byttenstudio" target="blank">official Bytten Studio Discord server</a>.</p>

                    <p>In addition, my passion for <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> drives me to contribute to the effort of documenting information about the game. I have recorded footages, made compilation videos and shared them on my YouTube channel for archival and reference purposes. I am also a contributor to the <a href="https://wiki.cassettebeasts.com/wiki/Main_Page" taregt="blank">official <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> wiki</a>. You can check out my <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> video playlists on YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQr78DF60PrBsgh8rQnzBWg/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=5" target="blank">here</a> and my user page on the <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> wiki <a href="https://wiki.cassettebeasts.com/wiki/User:Leilukin" target="blank">here</a>.</p>

                    <p>On Tumblr, I run the <a href="https://cassettebeastssource.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Cassette Beasts Source</a> blog, an unofficial <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> fan site blog that I founded on 25 February 2024. I created a fan site blog on Tumblr due to the fact that Bytten Studio does not have an official Tumblr account, and I want a Tumblr blog dedicated to sharing and archiving <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> news and fan works.</p>
