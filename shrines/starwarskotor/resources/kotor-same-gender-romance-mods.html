                    <p class="center-text">
                        [This list is also available on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l5cThs2A8PaUR4BlSEnlb2ZS5zrcnS3CeL58psjPfKI/edit" target="_blank">Google Docs</a>]
                    </p>

                    <p>The first <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</em> video game introduced Juhani, the very first confirmed gay character in any <em>Star Wars</em> media, including Legends, the old <em>Star Wars</em> Expanded Universe, and the very first canon same-gender romance option in any BioWare game. However, the <em>KotOR</em> series at large has little LGBTQ+ content, and except for Juhani, none of the romance options in both <em>KotOR</em> games are available for same-gender romances.</p>
                    
                    <p>Therefore, throughout the years, modders of the <em>KotOR</em> games have created various mods adding more same-gender romance options and content to the games to fill the void.</p>
                    
                    <p>Below is a list of all the same-gender romance mods that had been created for the <em>KotOR</em> game series throughout <em>KotOR</em>’s modding history, sorted by their original release dates in chronological order.</p>
                    
                    <p>Wanting to make your <em>KotOR</em> games more gay? Then this list is for you! This list also serves as an archive to document the history of same-gender romance mods for the <em>KotOR</em> series. Happy gayming!</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Some listed mods below have overlapping concepts and thus are not compatible with each other. Mods that are hosted exclusively on Gamefront are very old mods that were made in the 2000s, and thus may have compatibility issues with newer mods (not just ones that listed here).</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Warning: this list contains spoilers for both KotOR games.</strong></p>

                    <h3>Bi Carth</h3>
                    <ul class="mod-recs">
                        <li><strong>Mod Author:</strong> forgetcanon</li>
                        <li><strong>Original Release Date:</strong> July 20, 2015</li>

                        <li><strong>Mod Author:</strong> Kexikus</li>
                        <li><strong>Original Release Date:</strong> January 4, 2016</li>
                        <li><strong>Download:</strong> <a href="https://deadlystream.com/files/file/772-juhani-romance-enhancement/" target="_blank">Deadly Stream</a> | <a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/kotor/mods/73" target="_blank">Nexus Mods</a></li>

                    </ul>
                
                    <h3>JC’s Romance Enhancement: Biromantic Bastila for K1</h3>
                    <ul class="mod-recs">
                        <li><strong>Mod Author:</strong> JCarter426</li>
                        <li><strong>Original Release Date:</strong> January 19, 2020</li>
                        <li><strong>Download:</strong> <a href="https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1548-jcs-romance-enhancement-biromantic-bastila-for-k1/" target="_blank">Deadly Stream</a></li>
                        <li><strong>Mod Description:</strong> Another mod that allows female Revan to romance Bastila, but what makes this mod different is that it also further edits Bastila’s dialogue so Bastila would not refer to female Revan as a man. This mod also fixes the bugs with Bastila’s romance during the endgame.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                    <h3>JC's Romance Enhancement: Pan-Galactic Flirting for K1</h3>
                    <ul class="mod-recs">
                        <li><strong>Mod Author:</strong> JCarter426</li>
                        <li><strong>Original Release Date:</strong> July 6, 2022</li>
                        <li><strong>Download:</strong> <a href="https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2115-jcs-romance-enhancement-pan-galactic-flirting-for-k1/" target="_blank">Deadly Stream</a></li>
                        <li><strong>Mod Description:</strong> Allows the player to flirt with several NPCs regardless of gender.</li>
                        <li><strong>Note:</strong> This mod is essentially a modern and improved version of <strong>Bastila & Female Revan (Untold Love Story)</strong>. What makes JCarter426’s mod better is the fact that this mod uses an installer tool (TSLPatcher) to patch relevant dialogue files to improve compatibility with other mods, compared to Untold Love Story's installation method of putting dialogue files into the Override folder, which increases the chance of causing conflict with other mods.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                    <h3>Carth Onasi and Male PC Romance</h3>
                    <ul class="mod-recs">
                        <li><strong>Mod Author:</strong> Leilukin (me)</li>
                        <li><strong>Original Release Date:</strong> August 6, 2022</li>
                        <li><strong>Download:</strong> <a href="https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2140-carth-onasi-and-male-pc-romance/" target="_blank">Deadly Stream</a> | <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kotor/mods/1493" target="_blank">Nexus Mods</a></li>
                        <li><strong>Mod Description:</strong> Inspired by the aforementioned Bi Carth mod, this is my version of a male Revan and Carth romance mod. The biggest differences between my version and forgetcanon’s are that my mod is installed by patching relevant dialogue files, instead of putting modified dialogue files in the Override folder, and I have also edited Carth’s dialogue and spliced audio files to prevent Carth from referring to male Revan as a woman.</li>
                    </ul>

                <section class="article-section">
                    <h2 id="KotOR2">For <em>Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords</em></h2>
                    
                    <h3>Worthy of Note:</h3>
                    <p>Stoffe’s <a href="https://www.gamefront.com/files/handmaiden-choice-for-females/" target="_blank">Handmaiden Choice for Females</a> mod (originally released on April 23, 2005), which was the first mod ever made that allowed female Exiles to recruit Handmaiden as a party member, could technically be considered a same-gender romance mod, due to the fact that with this mod, female Exiles would also be able to romance Handmaiden by having her as a party member.</p>
                    <p>In addition, since Handmaiden replaces Disciple’s place on the Ebon Hawk crew in this mod, this mod also allows female Exiles to get the Visas romance scene after the Rebuilt Jedi Enclave sequence.</p>
                    <p>That being said, these are all side effects of Handmaiden being exclusive to male Exiles in the vanilla game. Handmaiden Choice for Females was not intentionally made with same-gender romances in mind.</p>
                    <p>Hassat Hunter had remade the mod into <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/the-sith-lords-restored-content-mod-tslrcm/addons/handmaiden-4-females-disciple-4-males-183" target="_blank">Handmaiden 4 Females - Disciple for Males</a> (originally released on March 14, 2014) to be compatible with The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod (TSLRCM). However, the mod is outdated and no longer supported.</p>
                
                    <h3>Alternate Revan Romances</h3>
                    <ul class="mod-recs">

                        <li><strong>Mod Description:</strong> Allows players to set Revan’s love interest(s), instead of letting the game assume male Revan is romantically involved with Bastila, while female Revan is romantically involved with Carth. Most notably, with this mod, Bastila can be chosen as female Revan’s love interest, and Carth can be chosen as male Revan’s love interest.</li>
                        <li><strong>Required Mod:</strong> <a href="https://deadlystream.com/files/file/578-tsl-restored-content-mod/" target="_blank">The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod (TSLRCM)</a></li>
                        <li><strong>WARNING:</strong> This mod is outdated, and it has game-breaking bugs. Use my REDUX version of the mod below instead. I am listing the original mod here for historical record purpose.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li><strong>Mod Description:</strong> Makes the Visas romance scene, which occurs near the endgame, available for the Exile regardless of gender.</li>

                        <li><strong>Mod Description:</strong> In addition to allowing Handmaiden to join a female Exile’s party and allowing Disciple to join a male Exile’s party, this mod also makes Handmaiden a romance option for a female Exile, and Disciple for a male Exile. It is worth noting that by allowing Handmaiden to join a female Exile, this mod also enables romantic subtext between Atris and the female Exile.</li>
