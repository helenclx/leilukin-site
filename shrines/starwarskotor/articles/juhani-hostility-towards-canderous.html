                <p>If you follow the modding scene of <cite>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</cite>, you might be aware of a conversation with Juhani where the player asks her why she is hostile towards Canderous. It is a commonly assumed that it is cut content, because the condition to trigger said conversation is unknown by the KotOR community, and there are mods that aim to restore said conversation.</p>
            
                <p>After thorough investigation into the game files, I finally discovered that it is actually possible to access Juhani's conversation about Canderous without any restoration mod. However, the issue is that in the vanilla game, the condition to make said conversation available is <em>very</em> specific, thus making it extremely easy to miss. Therefore, what restoration mods do to this specific Juhani conversation is making it easier to access.</p>
            
                <p style="font-size:1.5rem"><strong>Here are the conditions to make Juhani's conversation about Canderous without restoration mods:</strong></p>
            
                <p>Firstly, you need to have both Canderous and Juhani in your party when talking to certain NPCs on Dantooine. Canderous will make comments when you talk to those NPCs, then Juhani will interject and show hostility towards Canderous. Specifically, these interjections happen when you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Talk to Gar at the courtyard outside the Jedi Enclave and ask him about the problems with kath hounds and Mandalorians</li>
                    <li>Accuse Handon Guld of murdering Calder Nettic for cheating on his wife, during the "Murdered Settler" side quest</li>
                    <li>Tell Nurik Sandral you are investigating Shen Matale's disappearance, during the "Sandral-Matele Feud" side quest</li>
                </ul>
            
                <p>You need to hear Juhani's interjections to Canderous' comments on at least two of the above occasions.</p>
            
                <p>Secondly, you need to progress Juhani's conversations to the point where she reveals that her family fled to Taris because the Mandalorians attacked the Cathar homeworld and slaughtered many Cathar people. It is after this conversation where you get the dialogue option to ask Juhani why she is hostile towards Canderous.</p>
            
                <p>As evidence, I have recorded and compile the above video myself showing Juhani's interactions with Canderous and Juhani's conversation about Canderous.</p>
