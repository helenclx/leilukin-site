                            <p>If you cannot find those .MOD files in your Modules folder, your issue might be caused by your computer registering two different installation locations for <cite>KotOR 2</cite>. I suggest you check out <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=779622644" target="_blank">this guide on how to make sure your computer recognize the version of <cite>KotOR 2</cite> game where you want to install KotOR 2 mods on</a>. While the guide focuses on Steam version of KotOR 2, you could edit the registry to make your computer properly recognise the installation location of your KotOR 2 game.</p>
                            <p>Here are the default installation locations of <cite>KotOR 2</cite> depending on the game version:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><span class="bold-text">Steam (32-bit Windows):</span> C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Knights of the Old Republic II</li>

                            <p><strong>NO.</strong> I do not use Steam Workshop, and frankly, I hate the Steam Workshop for how terrible it is for modding <cite>KotOR 2</cite> and how much mod compatibility issues it causes. I suggest you read <a href="https://deadlystream.com/topic/7321-why-not-to-use-the-steam-workshop/" target="_blank">this post on why using Steam Workshop is NOT recommend for modding <cite>KotOR 2</cite></a>.

                            <p>See my answer to the previous question. I am not responsible for any bugs caused by you using any mods from the Steam Workshop. The only suggestion I will give you for compatibility issues between my mods and the Steam Workshop is to get rid of all your Steam Workshop mods entirely, and make sure there are no leftover Steam Workshop folders in your Steam directory. In order to do this, go to the Steam Workshop folder in your Steam directory (/\Steam\SteamApps\Workshop\), and delete all the sub-folders in the Steam Workshop folder.</p>

                            <p>Please read the “Mod Compatibility” section of my mod description and Read Me files before asking. If there is a mod you want to use that was not mentioned in my mod description and Read Me files, you can still ask me. Just make sure you tell me the actual name of the mod and ideally, provide a link to the mod you want to ask about, so I can check the mod out myself to confirm if it is compatible with my mod. Do not expect me to know the existence of every single KotOR mod out there.</p>

                            Can I use your mods with non-English localizations of the <cite>KOtOR</cite> games and The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod (TSLRCM)?
                        </summary>
                        <div class="qna-accordion__answer">
                            <p>No. I play and mod the <cite>KotOR</cite> game in English exclusively. Some of my mods in particular will cause your game to crash if you are playing a non-English localization of the <cite>KotOR</cite> games and TSLRCM, because those mods add custom dialogues that do not exist in the vanilla game in order to prevent characters from referring to the player character as the wrong gender. The only solution to crashes caused by you playing on a non-English localization is to play the <cite>KotOR</cite> games and TSLRCM in English.</p>
                            <p>If you are interested in making a non-English translation or localization of my mods yourself, you may contact me to ask for my permission to do so. However, since I am not familiar with any of the non-English languages officially supported by the <cite>KotOR</cite> games, I am unable to provide support for any issues players may have with using your non-English translation or localization of my mod.</p>

                            For your <cite>KotOR 2</cite> mods that require The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod (TSLRCM) to work, will you make an alternate version that does not require TSLRCM?
                        </summary>
                        <div class="qna-accordion__answer">
                            <p>No, I will not make a no-TSLRCM version of my mods that require TSLRCM to function. TSLRCM is widely agreed by players, including KotOR modders, to be an essential mod for the best experience with <cite>KotOR 2</cite>. Making a non-TSLRCM version of content mod like this would require me to spend extra time to replay <cite>KotOR 2</cite> without TSLRCM, and therefore subjecting myself to a lesser experience with the game, which I consider a massive waste of my time. In general, if you see any <cite>KotOR 2</cite> mod that requires TSLRCM to work (not just my mods), do not expect to see a non-TSLRCM version.</p>
                            <p>If you are having issues with using TSLRCM, I suggest you report the bugs you encountered and ask for help for solving your issues on the <a href="https://deadlystream.com/forum/4-tslrcm/" target="_blank">TSLRCM forum on Deadly Stream</a>.</p>

                            How to install your mods on the Xbox/Android/iOS/Switch/any other non-PC version of <cite>KotOR</cite> or <cite>KotOR 2</cite>?

                            <p>Sorry, <strong>I cannot help directly with modding the KotOR games on any console or mobile devices, because I only own the PC version of the <cite>KotOR</cite> games</strong>. I make no promises that I will port my KotOR mods for those platforms specifically either.</p>
                            <p>Some of my mods require TSLPatcher to install to make the mod work properly, especially if you also want to use other mods in addition to my mods and for <cite>KotOR 2</cite>, The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod. Simply copying and pasting files from my mod to your game's directory does NOT guarantee my mod will work as intended, and you may encounter bugs that could possibly game-breaking.</p>
                            <p>For Android and iOS users, I suggest referring to the KotOR subreddit's wiki, specifically their general instructions in their mobile mod builds. See <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kotor/wiki/k1fullbuildmobile/#wiki_installation_instructions" target="_blank">this page for <cite>KotOR 1</cite></a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kotor/wiki/k2fullbuildmobile/#wiki_general_instructions" target="_blank">this page for <cite>KotOR 2</cite></a>.</p>
                            <p>For Switch users, in order to mod the KotOR game on Switch, first you need to hack or modded your Switch, then use the <a href="https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2102-kotor-switch-modding-framework/" target="_blank">KotOR Switch Modding Framework</a> and <a href="https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2106-kotor-ii-switch-modding-framework/" target="_blank">KotOR II Switch Modding Framework</a> to install mods. According to JacqylFrost, the creator of these frameworks, both TSLRCM and my Handmaiden same-geneder romance mod work with the KotOR 2 version. I suggest you ask JacqylFrost directly if you need help with modding the KotOR games on Switch.</p>

If you also want to install Extended Enclave, you should use the compatibility patch included in my Handmaiden/Disciple romance mod, instead of the <a href="https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1304-partyswap-and-extended-enclave-compatibility-patch/" target="_blank">standalone patch</a> I made for the mod build.</p>

                            <p>No. The purpose of my same-gender romance mods is not necessary to add new content, but to allow players to experience the pre-existing romance content in the <cite>KotOR</cite> series without the heterosexual gender restrictions. Kissing or sex scenes are beyond the scope of my mods, and I do not necessary have the skills required (such as modelling, animations, etc.) to create them either, especially given how limited the animations in these old games are.</p>
                            <p>For Carth Onasi and Male PC Romance mod for KotOR 1, if you want your male PC to kiss Carth, you may install cjt0202's <a href="http://www.cjt0202.net/carth_romance.php" target="_blank">Carth Romance Fix</a> mod, then install the compatibility patch provided in my mod.</p>

                            Will you make a romance mod for Canderous/Bao-Dur/Mira/any other character with no romance content in the vanilla game?

                        <div class="qna-accordion__answer">
                            <p>No. Due to the fact that these characters were never intended to be romance options for the player character, creating romance content for these characters require extra work and effort, namely writing new dialogue, scripting and animating new scenes, and ideally, finding voice actors or using voice synthesithers for these new content, because some people (myself included) find it immersion-breaking to see party member suddenly become silent in certain lines despite being voiced in every other dialogue. This goes beyond my modding capabilities, and I do not have enough time and desire to put this large amount of work in video game mods for the foreseeable future.</p>

                            <p>I am a lesbian who would like to see more representation of LGBTQ+ people and relationships in media, including <cite>Star Wars</cite>, and I am not the only one who feels this way. I made these same-gender romance mods for fellow LGBTQ+ players who want more gay content in <cite>KotOR</cite> as well. I find <cite>KotOR 2</cite>'s complete lack of same-gender romance options especially disaappointing, since the first KotOR at least has Juhani as a canon lesbian romance option, so I made these mods to fill the void. In fact, after releasing my same-gender romance mods, many other LGBTQ+ players have expressed gratitute for the existence of these mods, and consider these mods a huge improvement to their <cite>KotOR</cite> experience</p>
                            <p>Cisgender and heterosexual people already get countless representations in media, including <cite>Star Wars</cite>. If the idea that everyone in your favorite piece of media could be gay makes you uncomfortable, perhaps you meed to examine why you feel that way. Keep in mind that <strong>LGBTQ+ people already have to see countless pieces of mainstream media filled with cisgender and heterosexual characters without a single LGBTQ+ character even existing</strong>.
                            <p>Frankly, opposing the concept of same-gender romance mods for video games for any reason is homophobic. As a gay person, this is a stance I will not change my mind on. Any comment or message that tries to argue with me otherwise will be ignored or deleted without response.</p>

                            Will you make Juhani a romance option for male Revan too in Alternate Revan Romances REDUX?
                        </summary>
                        <div class="qna-accordion__answer">
                            <p><strong>No</strong>. I will <strong><em>never</em></strong> make Juhani a romance option for male characters under <em>any</em> circumstances. I also do not support any mods that make Juhani a romance option for male characters.</p>
                            <p>Unlike Bastila and Carth, Juhani is a canon gay character (meaning she is officially confirmed to be attracted to the same gender exclusively) and she has always been intended to be a lesbian, a woman who is exclusively attracted to women. In fact, <a href="../articles/juhani-lesbian-evidence.html" target="_blank">the first <cite>KotOR</cite> game has gone out of its way to ensure ONLY female player characters can romance Juhani</a>.</p>
                            <p>Making Juhani a romance option for male characters cannot be compared to making Bastila and Carth same-gender romance options, because heterosexual people already get countless representations in media, including <cite>Star Wars</cite> and KotOR. Making heterosexual romance options like Batila and Carth available for same-gender romance options is out of desire for more LGBTQ+ representation, while making Juhani a romance option for male characters, including making Juhani bisexual, is erasing her lesbian sexuality and disrespecting lesbian representation.</p>
                            <p>As a lesbian myself, I utterly and firmly oppose the idea of making canon lesbian characters like Juhani romanceable by men (or canon gay male — as in, men who are exclusively attracted to men — characters romanceable by women), because it is very disrespectful for gay representation, especially consider the fact that Juhani is literally the only confirmed LGBTQ+ character in any KotOR game. Making canon lesbian characters like Juhani roanceable by men is also reminiscent of the real-life homophobic attitude that gay people's sexualities can be changed, which leads to <a href="https://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/policy/conversion-therapy-facts.pdf" target="_blank">“conversion therapy”</a>. Lesbians specifically are often discriminated and prejudiced against not only due to our same-gender attraction to women, but also our lack of attraction to men, to the extend there is a word for it: lesbophobia.</p>
                            <p>Alternate Revan Romances, and all my same-gender romance mods, are about adding more same-gender romance options, and not inherently about removing every gender restriction in romances without any thought or consideration. Ultimately, My reasons and motives for opposing changing Juhani's lesbian sexuality, and at the same time supporting making Bastila and Carth bi, are all about <strong>wanting more LGBTQ+ representation and respecting canon LGBTQ+ representation</strong>. It is not inherently about adhering to canon, but about respecting representation of marginalised groups like LGBTQ+ people.</p>
                            <p>Keeping canon gay chracters exclusive to same-gender romances, including keeping Juhani's romance exclusive to female chracters only, is a stance I am not going to change my mind on, so I would appreciate anyone not debating me on this.</p>

                                <li><strong>You may have some leftover Steam Workshop folders in your Steam directory</strong> that overrides the portion where Handmaiden is supposed to join your party. To solve this, go to the Steam Workshop folder in your Steam directory (/\Steam\SteamApps\Workshop\), and delete all the sub-folders in the Steam Workshop folder.</li>
                                <li>Similar to the above, <strong>you may have some leftover files from a mod you used in your previous playthrough</strong> in your KotOR 2 game directory that interferes the portion where Handmaiden is supposed to join your party.

When Disciple joins you, the game will show a notification informing you that you have received an item named PartySwap. That is what you need to use to add or remove Handmaiden in your party. Due to the game's limitations, it is impossible to add both Handmaiden and Disciple in the party selection screen without replacing one of the other party members. Handmaiden is still one of your party members, and you can still talk to her in your ship.</p>

                        <div class="qna-accordion__answer">
                            <p>No, and I see no point in making such mod when DarthTyren's PartySwap mod﻿ already exists to allow you to recruit both Handmaiden and Disciple in a single playthrough regardless of the Exile's gender. Additionally, my mod's primary goal is enabling same-gender romance options, so neither Male Exile/Handmaiden nor Female Exile/Disciple romance is a priority of my mod.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, if you want Handmaiden or Disciple in your party regardless of your Exile's gender, my recommendation is to install PartySwap. If you also want same-gender romance with Handmaiden or Disciple, install the PartySwap compatible installation option of my mod after PartySwap. Even if you prefer Handmaiden to Disciple, or vice versa, I will still recommend you to use PartySwap instead so you can get the most out of the party members in a single playthrough.</p>
