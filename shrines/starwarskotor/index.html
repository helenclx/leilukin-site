                    <p><cite>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</cite> (<cite>KotOR</cite>) is a space opera role-playing video game series. The series takes place in the fictional universe of Star Wars, with the story taking place approximately 4,000 years before the rise of the Galactic Empire. </p>
                    <p>The first title was developed by BioWare while the second (<cite>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords</cite>) was done by Obsidian Entertainmenr. Both games were published by LucasArts. The <cite>KOTOR</cite> series also includes a subsequent new comic book series. Both comic series were published by Dark Horse Comics and act as prequels to the video games.</p>

                    <h2>My Connection to the <cite>KotOR</cite> Series</h2>
                    <p>Even though I had been a <cite>Star Wars</cite> fan since I was 13 in 2005, I was not aware of the existence of the <cite>Knights of the Old Republic</cite> series until around 2010. I started playing the first <cite>KotOR</cite> game in early 2011, immediately followed by <cite>KotOR 2</cite>, and the series has been one of my special interests ever since.</p>

                    <p>My investment in the <cite>KotOR</cite> series has evolved over time, leading to me starting to get into modding the games in the mid-2010s. The very first <cite>KotOR</cite> mod I created was <a href="https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1012-tsl-improved-party-outfits/" target="_blank">TSL Improved Party Outfits</a> in 2015, while the first KotOR mod I released to the public was <a href="https://deadlystream.com/files/file/968-visas-marr-and-female-exile-romance/" target="_blank">Visas Marr and Female Exile Romance</a> on December 15, 2016.</p>
