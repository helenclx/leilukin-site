                        <p><em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</em> (<em>KotOR</em>) is a space opera role-playing video game series. The series takes place in the fictional universe of Star Wars, with the story taking place approximately 4,000 years before the rise of the Galactic Empire. </p>
                        <p>The first title was developed by BioWare while the second (<em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords</em>) was done by Obsidian Entertainmenr. Both games were published by LucasArts. The <em>KOTOR</em> series also includes a subsequent new comic book series. Both comic series were published by Dark Horse Comics and act as prequels to the video games.</p>

                        <h2>My Connection to the <em>KotOR</em> Series</h2>
                        <p>Even though I had been a <em>Star Wars</em> fan since I was 13 in 2005, I was not aware of the existence of the <em>Knights of the Old Republic</em> series until around 2010. I started playing the first <em>KotOR</em> game in early 2011, immediately followed by <em>KotOR 2</em>, and the series has been one of my special interests ever since.</p>

                        <p>My investment in the <em>KotOR</em> series has evolved over time, leading to me starting to get into modding the games in the mid-2010s. The very first <em>KotOR</em> mod I created was <a href="https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1012-tsl-improved-party-outfits/" target="_blank">TSL Improved Party Outfits</a> in 2015, while the first KotOR mod I released to the public was <a href="https://deadlystream.com/files/file/968-visas-marr-and-female-exile-romance/" target="_blank">Visas Marr and Female Exile Romance</a> on December 15, 2016.</p>

                        <p>I have also joined <a href="https://glitterskies.org/kotor/" target="_blank">Erased Identity</a> and <a href="https://glitterskies.org/kotor2/" target="_blank">Mysteries of Malachor</a>, the fan listings for the two <em>KotOR</em> games.</p>
