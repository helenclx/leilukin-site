                    <p>July 28th is my birthday, and in 2023, it also marks my first birthday after the launch of this personal website. I have had a nice birthday this year.</p>

                    <p>I spent the moments counting down to my birthday by playing <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite>, which has become one of my all-time favourite video games, to the extent that I am planning to make a shrine for it on this site. I defeated <a href="https://wiki.cassettebeasts.com/wiki/Lamento_Mori" target="_blank">Lamento Mori</a>, who in the lore of <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> is an <a href="https://wiki.cassettebeasts.com/wiki/Archangel" target="_blank">Archangel</a>, one of the eldritch entities in the game's settings, that specifically embodies humanity's fear of death. It is both amusing and poetic that I celebrated the countdown to my birthday by defeating a boss in a video game that represents death.</p>

                    <p>Since I have been playing and loving <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite>, and I want to support indie developers of indie games I love, I decided to purchase the Deluxe Edition on Steam, which includes the soundtrack, the art book and the Cosplay Pack as a birthday gift for myself. I received the base game as a Steam gift from a friend, and now I chose to use my money to support the developers myself as well. Not to mention, the music of <cite>Cassette Beasts</cite> is amazing. "Same Old Story", the battle theme of the Archangels, in particular, has become one of my all-time favourite battle themes in video games.</p>

                    <p>I had my birthday celebration with my family and received birthday wishes from friends.</p>

                    <p>Happy Birthday to me!</p>
