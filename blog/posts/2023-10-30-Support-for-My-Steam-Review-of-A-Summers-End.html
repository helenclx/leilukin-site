                <p>As part of my effort to support and promote <a href="https://www.asummersend.com/" target="blank"><cite>A Summer's End — Hong Kong 1986</cite></a>, the sapphic visual novel and my absolute favourite piece of queer art ever, I left a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/leilukin/recommended/1111370/" target="blank">glowing review on Steam</a> on 17 August 2023, talking about how much <cite>A Summer's End</cite> means too me as a Cantonese-speaking Chinese lesbian who grew up with Hong Kong media.</p>

                <p>Since then, as of the writing of this post on 30 October 2023, my review made to the top of the most helpful reviews in the past 90 days on the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1111370" target="blank">Steam store page of <cite>A Summer's End</cite></a> with 12 votes.</p>

                <p>In addition, I have received multiple Steam awards, with Steam Points along with them, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heartwarning, which awards 200 Steam Points, given by two people</li>
                    <li>Golden Unicorn, which awards 800 Steam Points, given by one person</li>
                    <li>Take My Points, which awards 1,600(!) Steam Points, given by one person</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Recently, on 22 October 2023, the <a href="https://leilukin.123guestbook.com/" target="_blank">guestbook</a> of my website here have also received a message from someone named Rob, who expressed appreciation for my Steam review:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Thanks so much for your steam review of a summer's end!! So glad you have this board, so I could thank you for the heart warming review. I want to get this game for a friend of mine who is new to speaking english, and the story definitely will resonate with her.</p>

                    <p>I am introducing her to visual novels to hopefully help aid in her learning and practice.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>I am amazed by the amount of appreciation my Steam review of <cite>A Summer's End</cite> has been given. Thank you! <cite>A Summer's End</cite> truly deserves all the love and support it can get.</p>

                <p>I cannot stress enough that <cite>A Summer's End</cite> is important because LGBTQ+ Hong Kong people and Cantonese speakers are criminally underrepresented in media. This is why we need to be vocal about our support for queer art made by non-white people, to signify to both the creators and every LGBTQ+ people that stories of queer non-white people deserve to be told.</p>
